<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>On my return to Columbia University in the fall of
1914 for the purpose of continuing my studies, I consulted
Professor H.A. Todd in regard to available subjects for
a doctoral dissertation. In the course of our conversation
he called my attention to a large volume which had
been presented to him by Mr. Archer M. Huntington.
It was a facsimile copy of the first edition of the Catalan
romance of chivalry, <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em>. Realizing that
here was an opportunity to become intimately acquainted
with a work that was made well known, in name at least,
by Cervantes in his celebrated <em>Don Quijote</em>, I eagerly
accepted the suggestion of Professor Todd to examine
the book with a view of ascertaining what possibilities
<em>Tirant lo Blanch</em> might offer in the field of literary
investigation. I immediately began to consult the
local libraries, and discovered that no elaborate and
extensive study of this work had been made. After
I had read the romance my mind was made up that the
subject of my dissertation would be based on this Catalan
work. I saw in it an abundance of material which provided
excellent opportunities for research work. I
experienced no little difficulty in selecting the special
problems and investigations which were to claim my
close and serious attention. Fortunately I again looked
over the cards in the Catalogue of the Library of the
Hispanic Society, and to my surprise I found a new card
which indicated that a critical study of this Catalan
work had been published in 1912, the <em>Estudio crítico de
Tirant lo Blanch</em> by Givanel Mas. After a careful study
of this comprehensive and scholarly production and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
other available sources of information pertaining to this
subject, I found myself deeply interested in the question
of the authorship of this romance, its principal sources,
and its historical setting.</p>

<p>During the course of my researches and investigations,
I have on numerous occasions been the recipient of
favors and acts of kindness which, although not bearing
directly on my work, nevertheless facilitated my labors
and stimulated my efforts. I therefore take advantage
of this opportunity to express my most sincere thanks
to the following persons: to Doctor Peter H. Goldsmith,
Director of the Inter-American Division of the American
Association for International Conciliation, and Editor of
the <em>Inter-America</em>; to Don F. Javier Salas, Consul
General of Spain at New York; to Professor H.C.
Heaton of New York University; and to Mr. Louis
Imbert of Columbia University.</p>

<p>To Professor E.B. Babcock of New York University
I am deeply indebted for sympathetic encouragement
and valuable suggestions, and for his patient reading of
the proof-sheets.</p>

<p>I am exceedingly grateful to Professor J.L. Gerig of
Columbia University for a critical reading of the MS.,
for suggesting certain improvements, for his good will
and helpful advice, and for his final reading of the proof-sheets.</p>

<p>It is extremely difficult to express in an adequate manner
my appreciation and gratitude to Professor H.A.
Todd, who, from the beginning to the end of the work,
advised, guided, and encouraged me. His kind and
never-failing interest in his students and their work is,
it is needless to say, a constant source of inspiration.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>In Chapter VI of the immortal work, <em>Don Quijote de la
Mancha</em>, is given a glowing account of the burning of the
books to which were ascribed the mental derangement of
the “ingenioso hidalgo.” In the passage in question,
Cervantes, speaking through the priest, pays the following
tribute to the Catalan romance of chivalry, <em>Tirant lo
Blanch</em>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>Válame Dios, dijo el Cura, dando una gran voz.—Que
aquí esté Tirante el Blanco! Dádmele acá,
compadre; que hago cuenta que he hallado en
él un tesoro de contento y una mina de pasatiempos.
Aquí está D. Quirieleisón de Montalbán,
valeroso caballero, y su hermano Tomás de Montalbán,
y el caballero Fonseca, con la batalla que
el valiente de Tirante hizo con el alano, y las
agudezas de la doncella Placerdemivida, con los
amores y embustes de la viuda Reposada, y la
señora Emperatriz, enamorada de Hipólito, su
escudero. Dígoos verdad, señor compadre, que,
por su estilo es éste el mejor libro del mundo:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>aquí comen los caballeros, y duermen, y mueren
en sus camas, y hacen testamento antes de su
muerte, con otras cosas de que todos los demás
libros deste género carecen. Con todo eso, os
digo que merecía el que lo compuso, pues no hizo
tantas necedades de industria, que le echaran
á galeras por todos los días de su vida.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1">[1]</a> Bless me, cried the Priest in a low voice, and is <em>Tirante the
White</em> here? Give it to me, gossip, for I reckon that I have found
herein a treasure of delight and a mine of entertainment. Here
you have Don Qurieleison of Montalvan, the valiant cavalier, and
his brother Thomas of Montalvan, and the Knight Fonseca, with
the fight which the valiant Tirante had with the big mastiff, and
the witty conceits of the damsel Placer-de-mi-vida, and the amours
and tricks of the widow Reposada, and my Lady the Empress
in love with Hippolito, her squire. I tell you truth, good master
gossip, that this for its style is the best book in the world. Here
the Knights eat and sleep and die in their beds, and make their
wills before dying, with other things that are wanting in all other
books of this sort. For all this, I say that he who wrote it is
well-deserving; for he did not commit follies purposely which
should send him to the galleys for the term of his life—<em>Don
Quixote of La Mancha</em>, translated by Henry Edward Watts, London,
1888.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2">[2]</a> <em>Cervantes, El ingenioso hidalgo Don Quijote de la Mancha.</em>

<p>
The last sentence of this quotation is not clear. It has become
the subject of many comments and discussions, but no wholly
satisfactory explanation has resulted. Menéndez y Pelayo intimates
that probably the sign of negation should be omitted from
the clause “pues no hizo tantas necedades de industria.” If this
were done the passage would make good sense. In the second
volume, page 76, of his <em>Introducción a los Orígenes de la Novela</em> he
suggests another explanation. He quotes a passage from Juan
Rufo which reads as follows: “mas a fe que en algo errárades, y
yo fuera presidente, que os avia de <em>echar a galeras pues no</em> podiades
<em>hazello de ignorancia</em>.” He is of the opinion that Cervantes expressed
or intended to express the same idea as that contained in
the words just quoted, but that in some way “industria” was
substituted for “ignorancia.” If Cervantes had used the latter
word instead of the former, the sentence in question would be
free from obscurity. However that may be, it is evident that the
judgment of Cervantes concerning <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em> was expressed
in a humorous way. Almost the whole of it consists of words of
praise. The only adverse criticism is to be found in the last sentence,
whereby Cervantes voices his objections to the nonsense and
obscene features of the work.
</p>

<p>
According to Menéndez y Pelayo, the whole sentence would be
clear if the clause, “pues no hizo tantas necedades de industria,”
were not one of negation. It seems to me possible and practicable
to remove the negative meaning from the clause without omitting
or changing any words that are now found in the text. The clause
may be made affirmative, emphatically affirmative, by resorting
to the rhetorical device of converting it into a negative interrogation.
The sentence may as a result appear complicated, but orally
expressed it would not seem unnatural or forced. The passage,
with this change in punctuation, would read: “Con todo eso, os
digo que merecía el que lo compuso, pues, ¿no hizo tantas necedades
de industria? que le echaran á galeras por todos los días
de su vida.”</p>

<p><em>Tirant Lo Blanch</em> was first published in Valencia, in
1490. Of this edition there are three copies extant:
one in the British Museum, another in the Biblioteca
Provincial in Valencia, and the third in the library of
the Hispanic Society of New York.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Mr. Archer M.
Huntington, founder of the above Society and a distinguished
patron of Spanish letters, had two hundred
facsimile copies made from the last one mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
One of these was used in the investigations connected
with this dissertation.</p>

<div class="footnote">

Letras de Barcelona en la recepción pública de D. Isidro Bonsoms
y Sicart</em>, Barcelona, 1907). Also see Juan Givanel Mas, <em>Estudio
crítico de Tirant lo Blanch</em>, Madrid, 1912; pp. 27-34.</p></div>

<p>A second edition was published in Barcelona, in 1497.
While I was in that city in the summer of 1915, I saw
fragments of a copy of this edition in the Institut d’Estudis
Catalans. It is to these fragments that Givanel Mas
refers in the following words: “Los únicos pliegos que
se conocen hoy día de la edición barcelonesa de 1497
del Tirant lo Blanch, se hallan en la Biblioteca del Institut
d’Estudis Catalans; comprenden desde el capítulo
ccxviiii al ccccxciii y del ccccxxxix al ccccxlv.”<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>It therefore affords me great pleasure to be able to
announce that the Hispanic Society of New York has
in its possession a complete copy of the edition of 1497.
It is gilt edged and is bound in leather of a yellowish,
almost brown, color. Its back is decorated with gilded
lines and bears the title <em>Roman del Cavaller</em> | <em>Tirant
Blanc</em> | Barcelona | 1497. The title page is missing,
but at the end of the book a fragment of paper bearing
the words “Tirant lo Blanch” in large letters is pasted
on a flyleaf. This fragment is probably a part of the
title page. The edges of several pages at the beginning
and at the close of the book had been torn, but they have
been neatly mended. A considerable number of pages
are somewhat soiled, but all are easily legible. The
facsimile reproduction of a page of the fragments in Barcelona,
which Givanel Mas has inserted in his work, coincides
exactly with the corresponding page of the book
in the library of the Hispanic Society. This author
has also set forth other interesting details concerning
the edition of 1497.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The colophon of the edition reads:</p>

<p>In the course of my studies of <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em>, I have
found myself confronted by three important questions:
(1) What are the real facts concerning the authorship
of this book of chivalry? (2) Is it true that Tirant,
the hero of the book, stands for the historic personage
Roger de Flor, in connection with the Catalan-Aragonese
expedition to Constantinople in the early years of the
fourteenth century? (3) What are the historical data
utilized by the author in the composition of his work?
Each of these problems I have investigated, and the
processes and results are duly set forth in their appropriate
places in this work. Three distinct parts of it
will be devoted to a consideration of these three questions.
They will be preceded by an analysis of <em>Tirant lo
Blanch</em>, to which the reader will be referred whenever it
may be deemed expedient or necessary. The analysis is,
moreover, intended to throw light on all the points mentioned
in the quotation from <em>Don Quijote</em>; to give a fuller
account of the activities of Tirant than has been done up
to the present time; and to give as accurate an idea of the
book as a reasonable allotment of space will permit.</p>

<p>On the delightful island of England there lived a noble
and valiant knight. For many years he performed with
great honor the duties pertaining to knighthood. This
noble representative of chivalry was Earl William of
Warwick. He was very strong and well-trained in the
use of arms. Many were the battles in which he took
part, and many a formidable adversary was vanquished
by him. (Chap. 2)</p>

<p>Having reached the age of fifty-five years, moved
by sorrow and contrition for the many deaths he had
caused in his knightly career, he resolved to do penance
for his sins by making a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. The
announcement of his intention to the Countess, his wife,
caused her a severe shock. The Earl called his servants
before him and paid them all that was due them and
much more. To the Countess he gave possession of the
whole county, with the privilege of doing with it what
she wished. He caused a gold ring to be made bearing
his escutcheon and that of the Countess. This ring was
wrought in such a way that it could be divided into two
parts, each being a complete ring in itself, but showing
only one half of the escutcheons. One of these
he gave to the Countess, asking her to keep it until his
return. In long lamentations she bewailed her sad fate.
But the Earl was resolute, and with tears streaming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
down his cheeks took leave of his wife and son, the latter
being only three months old. Leaving the city of Warwick
accompanied by a squire, he sailed to Alexandria,
and thence made his way to Jerusalem. Here he made
a careful and contrite confession of his sins and received
Holy Communion. After visiting the Holy Sepulcher
and other holy places in this city, he returned to Alexandria,
and set sail for Venice, where he dismissed his
squire, who, in accordance with the instructions given
him by his master, spread the report that Earl William
of Warwick was dead. The Earl also had merchants
write letters to England, in which they told that William
of Warwick had died while returning from Jerusalem.
The Countess was grief-stricken when she received the
bad tidings, and caused funeral obsequies to be celebrated
in a manner befitting the Earl’s station. (Chaps. 2-4)</p>

<p>After some time had elapsed the Earl returned to his
native land. He was greatly changed in appearance.
Long hair hung over his shoulders, and his snow-white
beard reached to his girdle. In the garb of a Franciscan
monk, he came to a hermitage of Our Lady not far
distant from the city of Warwick, and there lived all
alone, avoiding all worldly affairs in order that he might
make atonement for his transgressions. Once a week
he went into the city of Warwick to solicit alms. No
one recognized him, on account of his beard and long
hair. He used to go to the Countess to ask for charity,
and she, touched by his profound humility, would give
to him more than to the other mendicants. And thus
he lived undisturbed for some time. (Chap. 4)</p>

<p>Now it happened that corsairs had plundered a city belonging
to the King of Canary. This Moorish king became
enraged when he heard of it, and prepared a great fleet
to invade England. One dark night this fleet entered
the port of Dantona [Hampton, i.e. Southampton]. The
Moors disembarked without being seen or heard by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
English. When the English king was informed of this invasion,
he quickly gathered all his available men to drive
back the invaders, but his forces were defeated and he
was obliged to retreat towards the city of Saint Thomas of
Canterbury. Along a river near this place he made a
stand, but was again defeated. After losing nine battles,
one after another, he sought refuge in the city of London.
But the scarcity of provisions soon compelled him to
evacuate this place, and he withdrew to the city of Warwick,
which was well supplied with food, arms and all the
instruments of warfare. The Countess offered all that
was in her county to the unfortunate monarch. The
Moors pursued the retreating forces, and on the way
captured the castle of Alimburch [Wellingborough?]. The
English king from a tower in the city of Warwick could
see the Moors devastating the land and slaying his Christian
people, both men and women. Dark despair came
over him. He could not bear this sight, but came down
from the tower and retired to a small chamber where he
lamented and prayed. In his great affliction, he bowed
his head upon the bed, and presently it seemed to him
that a beautiful lady in white, with a child in her arms,
entered the chamber. She was attended by many other
ladies who were chanting the “Magnificat.” When
the singing ceased, the Lady approached him, and, placing
her hand on his head, she said: “Fear not, O King;
have confidence; the Son and the Mother will help you
in your great tribulation. As a sign of peace, kiss on the
mouth the first man with a long beard whom you shall
see, and who will ask you for alms. Request him to lay
aside his garment, and make him captain of all your
forces.” When the king opened his eyes the vision had
vanished, but the dream had been so vivid that he could
not forget it. The next morning the hermit, William
of Warwick, while gathering herbs, saw the Moorish
forces overrunning all the surrounding country, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
sought refuge in the city of Warwick. He went to the
castle to ask the Countess for alms, and there met the
king, whom he immediately approached. He knelt down
before him and asked for charity. The king, bidding him
arise, kissed him on the mouth and led him into a room of
the castle, where he asked him to put aside his penitent
garb and to take up arms. The hermit at first declined,
but finally agreed to yield to the wishes of the king, since
he would be taking up arms to defend Christianity and
to spread the Holy Catholic faith. (Chaps. 5-10)</p>

<p>In his travels in the East the hermit had learned to
make certain grenades which would burn and which no
water could extinguish. For several days he was busy
making some of these. One day he informed the king
he was ready to carry out a plan by which he hoped to
deal a severe blow to the enemy. That night he disguised
himself as a Moor and, carrying a number of
grenades, reached the camp of the invaders. He set fire
to the camp, and while the infidels were trying to extinguish
the fire, the English came out of the city and
attacked them. Many Moors were slain, and the rest fled
in disorder to the castle of Alimburch. (Chaps. 10-12)</p>

<p>From this place, the great King of Canary sent ambassadors
to the English king with a letter in which he
proposed that, to avoid further bloodshed, the two kings
should engage in mortal combat. If the Moorish king
should be the victor, the English king was to recognize
him as his lord and pay a heavy tribute every year.
If, on the other hand, the English king should win, then
the Moors were to return to their own land, and England
should again enjoy peace. This proposal was immediately
accepted by the English sovereign. (Chaps. 13-14)</p>

<p>Then the King of England convened the General
Council to deliberate over the matter. The hermit
was first asked to give his advice. He suggested that
since the Moorish king was a strong and hardy man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and the English king young and feeble, some one who
was more likely to win over such a formidable adversary
should fight in place of England’s king. Moreover,
he proposed that the Duke of Lancaster, the uncle of
the king, should be the person to represent him in the
combat. But immediately three dukes, the Duke of
Gloucester, the Duke of Bedford, and the Duke of Exeter,
protested loudly that, since they were more closely
related to the king, the honor of representing him should
devolve upon them. But the king was unwilling that
any one should fight in his place. However, he was
finally persuaded that this should be done, and he yielded
only on condition that he be permitted to name the
substitute, to whom he also intended to surrender the
royal crown and scepter. He nominated the hermit,
who wished to decline, but was finally induced to put
on the royal robes. The regal power was then conferred
upon him in the presence of a notary. Arms were brought,
from which he was to select those that he preferred.
But he chose none of these. He asked that the arms of
William of Warwick be obtained from the Countess.
The latter sent certain arms, but they were not the
ones that he wanted. Those that he desired were kept
in the chamber of the Countess. The astonished lady
gave the hermit permission to enter her chamber, and he
there equipped himself for the coming combat. (Chaps.
14-19)</p>

<p>The hermit-king spent all that night in the church,
kneeling before the altar, upon which he had placed his
arms. After mass the next morning he ate to strengthen
his body and then armed himself for the fight. Finally
the adversaries met, and the fighting was fast and furious.
Suddenly the hermit-king cut off one of his opponent’s
arms, and a few moments later, his head. England’s
champion had won, and great was the rejoicing among
the Christians. (Chap. 19)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day the English sent ambassadors to the
infidels to request them to leave the country, as had been
stipulated in the agreement made before the combat
took place, but the Moors in great wrath cut off the heads
of these ambassadors. They put the heads in a sack
and sent them back to the English. The hermit-king
was astounded when this cruel and treacherous deed
was reported to him, and he made a solemn vow never
to go under any roof except that of the church to hear
mass, until he had driven the whole Moorish tribe out
of the kingdom. And he ordered that all male subjects
of the crown over the age of eleven years and under
seventy should take up arms to fight the invaders.
(Chaps. 19-20)</p>

<p>When the Countess learned that her son, who was
barely eleven years old, would be obliged to fight the
Moors, she became frantic. She implored the hermit-king
to permit her to keep her son, the only comfort
of her life, but he would not yield to her entreaties.
And when the boy himself expressed an eagerness to go
against the enemy, she realized that all her petitions would
be in vain, and, with despair in her heart, she gave the
lad her blessing. (Chaps. 20-22)</p>

<p>The hermit-king gathered his forces and led them out
upon a plain before the city, and there they established
their camp. Around it a high wall was thrown up.
An opening was left on one side and there caltrops were
placed and pitfalls were dug. When the Moors attacked
the camp, they were slaughtered in great numbers.
Finally they began to retreat. The Christians followed
them and killed many more in the pursuit. The young
son of the Countess slew a doughty Moor, and the king,
after dubbing him, threw him upon the slain Saracen,
so that the boy’s hands and face became covered with
blood. That was the lad’s baptism of blood. (Chaps.
24-25)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>After this disastrous defeat the Moors again returned
to the castle of Alimburch. The English made an assault
upon this stronghold and succeeded in setting it on
fire. The infidels were obliged to come out, and all that
emerged were slain, while all the rest that were found in
the kingdom were put to death. The victorious English
then marched to Dantona, threw into the sea all the
Moors that they encountered there, and destroyed all
the ships in which they had come. (Chap. 25)</p>

<p>When peace and order were again established on the
island of England, the hermit-king decided to make himself
known to the Countess, and in order that he might
be free to return to his hermitage and his penitential
life, he purposed to restore the kingdom to the former
sovereign. (Chap. 26)</p>

<p>Accordingly, he sent a chamberlain with the half-ring
to the Countess. The messenger said to her: “He
who has loved you with infinite love, and who still loves
you, sends you this ring.” She took it and was startled.
She hurried to her chamber, where she said a short
prayer. Then she opened the jewel-case and took a ring
from it. She placed one of the rings on top of the other,
and behold they fitted together perfectly and the escutcheons
were complete. All perturbed and excited,
she rushed towards the door, but before she was able to
reach it, she fell to the floor in a swoon. The chamberlain
hurried to the king and announced that the Countess
had fallen dead. The king hurried to her room. Doctors
were already there trying to revive her. Finally
she recovered her senses, arose, and threw herself on
her knees before the king, who raised her up from the
floor and embraced her and kissed her many times.
Then he announced that he was the Earl of Warwick.
And when the people generally knew that the hermit-king
was their own William of Warwick, there was great
rejoicing. All the nobility went to the church with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
reunited couple and offered up to heaven infinite praise
and thanks. Then, in a triumphant procession, they
returned to the castle, where a sumptuous banquet was
served. (Chap. 26)</p>

<p>Nine days later there arrived four hundred carts laden
with gold and silver, all of which had been taken from
the Moors. The Duke of Bedford, the Duke of Gloucester,
the Earl of Salisbury, and the Earl of Stafford
were put in charge of this immense treasure. A meeting
of the General Council was ordered for the next day.
(Chap. 26)</p>

<p>At this council the earl gave instructions concerning
the distribution of the booty, and restored to the former
ruler the crown, scepter, and royal robes. He himself
immediately put on again the garb of the Franciscan
order. The reinstated king begged him to remain at his
court. He offered him the principality of Wales, but
he would not accept it. All the members of the council
besought him to stay, but he answered that he must return
to serve God. When the king realized that he could
not induce him to dwell amongst them, he gave half of
the kingdom of Cornwall to the earl’s son, to whom
was also granted the privilege of wearing an iron crown.
The hermit gave thanks to the king for the gift and
the honors bestowed on his son, and then bade farewell
to His Majesty and his court. He went to a small villa
in his county, where he remained several days. The
king sent him thirty carts loaded with the most precious
things contained in the booty captured from the Moors,
but he refused to accept any of it. When the king left
the city of Warwick he sent for the earl’s son, and, at the
city gate, he appointed him Grand Constable of all England.
Then the king departed for London. (Chap. 27)</p>

<p>The Countess visited her husband, the hermit, in
the villa, and finally persuaded him to have a hermitage
built, which was to consist of a church, with an apartment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
on each side of it, one for him and the other for
her. After its completion, and just about the time that
they were going to live there, the Earl of Northumberland
came to them as an ambassador of the king. His
mission was to request the noble couple to come to London.
The king was going to marry the daughter of the
King of France, and was anxious that the Countess should
instruct the queen in the practices and customs of England.
The hermit replied that he must keep the vow
that he had made to serve God, but he should be very
happy if the Countess would be willing to go. And
the Countess, moved by the wish of her husband and
by a sense of duty to her sovereign lord, expressed her
willingness to comply with the king’s request. And thus,
William of Warwick and his wife were again separated;
she went to London, and he entered the new hermitage,
which stood in a dense grove, in which there was a
clear spring, whose waters flowed with a gentle murmur
through the flowers and green grasses of a beautiful
meadow. And every day after the hermit had finished
his hours he would come out under a beautiful pine tree
that stood in the center of this meadow, to watch the
animals that came to drink from this crystal spring.
(Chap. 27)</p>

<p>The King of England, in order to keep his people well-trained
in the use of arms, and to celebrate his approaching
marriage in a befitting manner, announced that a
General Court would be held in London at which many
exercises of arms should take place. The announcement
of the great festivities which the king was preparing
was spread throughout all the Christian lands.
Now it happened that a young nobleman from Brittany
started on his way to attend the great event, and with
him several other youths. And as they were riding along,
he dropped somewhat behind the others, and, being weary
from the long journey, fell asleep. His steed, instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
of following the company, took a path which led to the
crystal spring where the hermit was reading a book
entitled <em>Arbre de Batalles</em>. When the horse came to the
spring, it lowered its head to drink, and this movement
awakened the rider, who opened his eyes and saw before
him the white-bearded hermit. Quickly dismounting,
he bowed to him. The hermit received him kindly,
and asked his name, and why he had come to that deserted
place. The youth answered: “My father is
Lord of the March of Tirania, and my mother’s name is
Blancha; therefore it has pleased them to call me Tirant
lo Blanch.” He then related that he and several young
noblemen were on their way to attend the General Court
which the English king had announced and at which
those who wished to become knights would have an
opportunity to realize their ambition. When he had
said this, the hermit grew pensive and, when asked
wherefore, replied that he was thinking of knighthood
and the duties and obligations of knights. Young Tirant
then begged him to tell about the order of knighthood.
The hermit read to him a chapter from the <em>Arbre de
Batalles</em>, which was a kind of treatise on the order of
chivalry. And he explained the origin of chivalry;
its noble purpose; the significance of the arms and the
different parts of armor; how a knight who has disgraced
the order is degraded; and he named some of the great
knights of olden times. When asked who were the best
knights of England at that very time, he mentioned the
names of the good knight Muntanyanegre, the Duke
of Exeter, and Sir John Stuart. Tirant, disappointed
at this answer, asked why he did not make mention of
the Earl William of Warwick, who had won so many
battles in France and Italy, and in many other countries;
who had saved the life of the Countess of Belestar,
accused of adultery by her husband and her three sons;
who had snatched a child away from a lion and returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
it to its mother; and who vanquished the Moors in
England and liberated many English captives. The
hermit replied that he had heard of William of Warwick,
but having never seen him he did not mention his name.
(Chaps. 28-38)</p>

<p>While Tirant was receiving instructions in knighthood
from the hermit, his companions were traveling
on, and, although he would gladly have remained longer,
it was necessary to depart if he did not wish to travel
to London alone. The hermit bade him farewell, and
gave him the book. He invited Tirant to visit him on
his return, and the invitation was accepted. Then the
young aspirant for the honors of knighthood resumed
his journey to London. Some of his companions, when
they missed him, turned back, and when they found him,
he was riding along reading the book. The company
of young men arrived in London a few days before the
beginning of the festivities. (Chap. 39)</p>

<p>The feast of St. John was the wedding day of the king,
and on that day began the festivities of the General
Court. The celebration continued for a year and a day.
Then the visitors took leave of the king and the queen,
and returned to their respective homes. Tirant, remembering
his promise, stopped at the hermitage with
his companions. They were embraced one by one by
the venerable man, and then they sat down with him
on the grass underneath the large pine tree. At the
request of the hermit, Tirant described the principal
events that had taken place at London. He told of the
generous hospitality of the king; of the great procession
when the king went out of the city to meet his betrothed;
of the manner in which the exercises of arms were conducted;
and of the splendor and merriment at the royal
nuptials. He spoke also of those who essayed their
skill in knightly combats, praising highly the Duke of
Aygues Vives, the Duke of Cleves, and the brother of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Duke of Burgundy. But the contest that he admired
most of all was the one in which a youth who did not
seem to be more than fourteen or fifteen years old took
part. This youthful knight was called the Grand Constable
of England. His mother and the king, too, had
forbidden him to participate in any of the combats.
But he came to Tirant and asked him for permission to
use his arms and steed. He begged so well that Tirant
was unable to refuse. In this contest the youth slew
the Senyor de Escala Rompuda. The king chided him
for having entered the lists without permission, but the
young Constable answered that it was not right that he
should be denied the privilege of following the footsteps
of his valiant father, William, Earl of Warwick. The
Countess sent for Tirant and begged him never again
to do anything that might cause her to lose the only joy
and comfort that she had in this life. And he promised
that he would never willingly put the life of her son in
jeopardy. (Chaps. 39-57)</p>

<p>The hermit had already twice asked who had been
declared the best and greatest knight among the victors.
But Tirant seemed to pay no attention to his questions.
And finally the hermit said: “But, Tirant, why do you
not answer my question?” Then arose one of the company
and his name was Diaphebus. He drew forth
a parchment saying that the document in his hands
would answer the question. This he read to the hermit,
who was delighted when he heard that it was a proclamation
to the world that the noble and valiant Tirant
lo Blanch was declared the best knight of all those that
had taken part in the exercises of arms at the festivities
connected with the General Court. It also contained the
instructions given by the king that Tirant should be
placed on a white steed and that all, walking with the
king, should escort the hero to the church of Saint George,
where a solemn high mass would be celebrated in honor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
of this most excellent knight. The document was signed
by “Rex Enricus,” and by judges of the field, heralds,
and the great lords in attendance. (Chaps. 57-58)</p>

<p>After the reading of the document, the hermit asked
Diaphebus to tell of some of Tirant’s exploits, whereupon
our hero withdrew from the company to busy himself
with giving orders for the putting up of the tents and
the preparation of supper. Diaphebus then related how
Tirant was the first person upon whom the honor of
knighthood was conferred, and the first one to engage
in combat with one of the champions of the field. In
this contest, which was fought on horseback, he slew his
adversary. Then he challenged another champion of
the field to a <em>combat à outrance</em> on foot. In this he
succeeded in striking his opponent to the ground. Not
wishing to take his life, he asked the fallen knight to
beg for mercy, but the latter answered that he was the
Caualler de Muntalt, knighted by the Earl of Warwick,
loved and feared by many, and that he preferred to die
with honor rather than live in disgrace. And Tirant,
regretting that knights were by their very profession
obliged to be cruel, placed the point of his dagger over
the eye of his victim, and then struck a sharp blow on
the end of the handle so that the point came out on the
other side of his head. (Chaps. 58-60)</p>

<p>One day the king and the queen, accompanied by many
knights and ladies, went out into a meadow for recreation.
With them was “Beautiful Agnes,” the daughter
of the Duke of Berry. On this day she wore a precious
brooch. Tirant approached her and praised her many
excellent qualities. He then asked her for that brooch,
saying that in return for the favor he would be willing
to meet any knight in a <em>combat à outrance</em>. She gave
him permission to take it. Thereupon Tirant detached it
from her bodice and fastened it on his cap. The following
day the Senyor de les Viles Ermes, a valiant and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
well-trained knight, came to Tirant, and, after telling him
that from his very childhood he had loved Agnes, demanded
that the brooch be given him. Threatening to
kill Tirant if the latter should refuse, he tried to take
it from him by force, whereupon a fight ensued in which
the friends of each took part, and twelve men were killed
before peace could be restored. Three days later, the
Senyor de les Viles Ermes sent a challenge to Tirant and
it was immediately accepted. Tirant relinquished his
right to select the arms, and also gave his adversary
the privilege of designating the manner in which the
duel was to be fought. Thereupon the latter specified
that the combat should be fought on foot. Each of
the combatants should wear a plain shirt, and have a
wreath of flowers on his head. No other clothing was
to be worn. Each should be provided with a paper
shield and a pointed double-edged Genoese dagger. The
duel was fought in a neighboring forest early in the
morning. The two adversaries inflicted many horrible
wounds on each other. Their white shirts were red with
the blood that flowed copiously from their wounds.
Gradually they grew weaker and weaker. Finally Tirant
made a desperate thrust and struck his opponent
just over the heart. At the same time he himself received
a blow on the head which made him sink to the ground
even before his antagonist fell dead. Four of Tirant’s
wounds were pronounced fatal, but fortunately they
gradually healed and his life was saved. (Chaps. 60-68)</p>

<p>The Prince of Wales, too, had come to attend the festivities,
and since he was fond of hunting he brought with
him several enormous dogs. One day the king, accompanied
by several knights, visited him. And it happened
that on that same day Tirant was riding by the house
in which the prince lived. A large mastiff having broken
loose from his chain, came out and rushed towards Tirant.
Our hero dismounted and drew his sword, and when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
dog saw the gleaming blade, it turned away. The
king and the prince saw this, and the latter, knowing
the ferocious nature of the animal, remarked that a
splendid fight was in prospect. Tirant remounted his
steed and proceeded on his way, but he had hardly
advanced twenty paces, when the mastiff again rushed
at him with great fury, and the rider was a second time
obliged to alight from his horse. He again drew his
sword and advanced towards the savage animal, when
the latter, being afraid of the shining weapon, retreated.
Then Tirant threw aside his sword, for he concluded
that it was not right nor fair that he should use arms
when the dog had none. The mastiff rushed for the
weapon, seized it with his teeth, and carried it a short
distance away. And as he came back towards Tirant,
the latter said: “Now we shall fight on equal terms;
I shall use the same kind of weapons to do you harm,
as you will employ against me.” They attacked each
other with fierceness. The gigantic mastiff caused Tirant
to fall three times. Finally the latter seized the raging
beast by the throat and strangled it with all his
might. At the same time he bit its cheek so savagely
that the animal fell dead on the ground. The king and
others came out immediately, and carried Tirant into
the house. Doctors were called and they treated the
many wounds on his arms and legs. For this victory
he received the same honors as if he had vanquished
a formidable knight in the lists. (Chap. 68)</p>

<p>The King of Friesland, the King of Poland, the Duke
of Burgundy, and the Duke of Bavaria met in the city of
Rome on the occasion of an important celebration of the
Church. Among other subjects of their conversation,
they came to speak of the King of England and the
wonderful festivities and exercises of arms that were
taking place at his court. They decided to go there
<em>incognito</em> and try their fortune in the lists. Tirant met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
each of them in mortal combat, and vanquished them all.
(Chaps. 68-73)</p>

<p>Some time after came the knight Villa Fermosa from
Scotland. The lady who had captivated his soul would
not listen to him, nor would she speak to him until he
had vanquished the renowned knight, Tirant lo Blanch.
But the latter did not wish to accept the challenge, for
his wounds were not yet healed. The Scottish knight,
however, would not take a refusal, and finally Tirant consented
to meet him, and promised that he would not fight
any other knight until after their combat. (Chap. 74)</p>

<p>But this promise Tirant was obliged to break, for the
following reasons. When the news of the death of the
King of Friesland reached his kingdom, there was great
grief among his subjects. The favorite of the dead king,
Kirielayson de Muntalba, who was a man strong and
valorous, and descended from a race of giants, determined
to make Tirant pay dearly for slaying his lord the king.
He sent a challenge, in which he accused him of having
vanquished the two kings and the two dukes through
treachery. Tirant, in his answer, gave him the lie and
accepted the challenge. The giant-knight came, but
before the combat he went to visit the tombs of those
whose death he wished to avenge. Seeing the shields
of the vanquished, over which the shields of Tirant
had been placed, he began to weep and lament. In
a fit of anger he took down Tirant’s shields and threw
them on the ground. Then he noticed that they were
painted on the tabernacle over the tomb. Blind with
rage, he struck them with his head so violently that he
fell half unconscious. A few moments later, when he
opened the tabernacle and saw the lifeless body of his
king and sovereign, his gall bladder burst, and he died
instantly. (Chaps. 74-80)</p>

<p>The unsuccessful avenger of the King of Friesland had
a brother whose name was Thomas de Muntalba, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
had been the favorite of the other monarch, the King
of Poland. Thomas came to England with a grim determination
to avenge the death not only of the kings
and dukes, but also of his brother. He was well built,
of great strength, and so tall that Tirant scarcely reached
up to his waist. It was said that he was the tallest man
in all Christendom. He, too, accused our distinguished
champion of having slain his victims treacherously,
and challenged him to mortal combat. The challenge
was accepted. The friends of Tirant tried to prevent
the duel, for they feared that he might be vanquished.
Finally the combat took place and it was of long duration.
The giant’s blows were powerful. Once they forced
Tirant to his knees, but at that very moment he wounded
his opponent in the groin. In the violence of the fight
the big knight let fall his ax. Tirant told him that
he would permit him to pick it up, if he would retract
his false accusation of treachery. Thomas de Muntalba
did so, and recovered his ax. Then the combat began
again and it became more furious than before. Finally
the gigantic adversary had difficulty in breathing, and
was becoming weak from loss of blood. Tirant made
a desperate effort to put an end to the fight. He succeeded
in landing two powerful blows on the head of his
opponent, who fell to the ground. Tirant quickly placed
the point of his dagger over one of the eyes of the giant,
and at the same time told him if he would acknowledge
that he was vanquished his life would be spared. The
fallen knight answered that since Fate willed it, he would
deliver himself into his hands. Then Tirant went into
the middle of the field, knelt down, and gave praise and
thanks to God for the victory. Thomas de Muntalba
was degraded and later he became a monk of the Franciscan
order. (Chaps. 80-84)</p>

<p>A few days after this event Tirant went to Scotland
to engage in combat with the knight Villa Fermosa.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
The Queen of Scotland acted as judge of the contest.
She stopped the combat before either of the knights had
come to grief. (Chap. 84)</p>

<p>When the hermit had heard all these things, he expressed
his delight at the many successes and great honors that
young Tirant had won. In the meantime our modest
hero had tables set up beside the clear spring, and an
excellent supper was awaiting the hermit and all the rest.
After supper the venerable man retired to the hermitage.
The next day, after he had said his hours, he came out
again. Tirant and his companions went to receive him,
and they sat on the grass as the day before. Then
Diaphebus tells about the institution of the Order of
the Garter. He narrates the well-known incident which
caused the king to say; “Puni soyt qui mal hi pense.”
He relates how His Royal Majesty instituted the above-named
fraternity as a result of that incident. He gives
a detailed description of the Church of St. George in
the castle of Windsor; he recounts the rules of the Order
and describes the ceremonies; he repeats the oaths
of the members of the Order, and the vows of the
ladies of honor. He tells how the king selected twenty-five
knights to make up the membership so that with the
king the members numbered twenty-six, and that the
king himself was the first to swear to obey all the rules.
Tirant, being the best knight of all those at the court,
was the first to be chosen. And among the other members
selected was John of Warwick, the Grand Constable
of England. (Chaps. 84-97)</p>

<p>Tirant and his companions stayed with the hermit
for ten days. On the eve of their departure for Brittany,
they asked him to sleep in one of their tents for that
night, since they were going to leave early in the morning
and were eager to have his blessing before starting.
Their request was granted. The next morning, after
they had departed, he returned to the hermitage, which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
to his great surprise, he found well stocked with all
manner of provisions. He even found wood and coal
within, so that it would not be necessary for him to go
out when the weather was bad. The hermit was deeply
moved by this act of kindness, and attributed it to
Tirant, who, he resolved, should ever be remembered in
his prayers. (Chap. 97)</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II
<br />
<small>TIRANT SUCCORS THE KNIGHTS OF RHODES</small></h3>


<p>The news of the great deeds of Tirant preceded him,
and when he arrived in Brittany he was received with
great honor in the city of Nantes by the Duke of Brittany
and a multitude of people. One day, while Tirant
was engaged in conversation with the duke, two knights
arrived from the court of the King of France, who related
how the Knights of Saint John had left Jerusalem when
that city fell, and established themselves on the island
of Rhodes. The Sultan of Cairo was highly displeased
that Christians should live on that island and made
preparations to capture it. The Genoese, discovering
the intentions of the Sultan, and realizing what an important
seaport it afforded, planned to conquer it for themselves,
but their designs and plans were discovered by
the Knights of Rhodes and frustrated. The captain
of the unsuccessful Genoese venture then sailed to Beirut,
where the Sultan was at that time, and told all that had
happened. It was then agreed that the Sultan in person
should go to Rhodes with as large an army as possible.
One hundred and fifty thousand Moors were taken to
the island, and they destroyed everything on it, except
the city, which they besieged. The port of the city
was blockaded so that no food could reach the inhabitants.
The Grand Master of the Knights, seeing that their
plight was daily becoming more and more critical, sent
letters to the Pope, the Emperor, and to all the Christian
kings and princes, begging them to come to their aid.
The King of France received one of these appeals, but
paid little attention to it. (Chaps. 97-99)</p>

<p>Tirant, however, was eager to give them help. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
interviewed mariners, from whom he learned that it was
possible to reach the castle of Rhodes. Encouraged by
this information, he bought a large ship and ordered it
to be well armed and loaded with provisions. Tirant’s
intentions were to go to Jerusalem after having succored
Rhodes. Philip, the youngest son of the King of France,
an awkward and not very intelligent youth, desired to
visit the Holy City, and Tirant was very glad to have
him as companion. When all was ready, they embarked
and the boat proceeded on its way. The first landing
was made at Lisbon. They were cordially received
by the King of Portugal and remained at his court for
ten days. Then they resumed their voyage. They
passed Cape Saint Vincent without incident, but upon
entering the Strait of Gibraltar, they were attacked by
a large number of Moorish ships. But Tirant’s ship
was so large and so well defended, especially by a certain
mariner named Cataquefaras, that it finally escaped
from its pursuers. Many of the men on the ship, including
Tirant and Philip, were wounded, and the vessel
was badly damaged. It landed at an uninhabited island,
where the crew repaired the ship. Then they again set
sail, and followed the shores of Barbary. Not only
Moorish but also Genoese ships attacked and harassed
them until they came near Tunis. Tirant’s vessel landed
at Palermo in Sicily to take on more provisions. The
royal family of Sicily gave Tirant and Philip a hearty
welcome, and during their stay an interesting love affair
developed between Philip and the princess Ricomana,
which Tirant took great pleasure in promoting. Much
of his time was spent at the elbow of Philip, preventing
or rectifying awkward blunders. Finally he spoke to
the king in behalf of Philip. The king was delighted at
the prospect of uniting the House of Sicily with that of
France, and requested Tirant to write to the French king
in regard to the matter. (Chaps. 99-104)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>One day the news came to Sicily that the city of Rhodes
was in dire distress and would fall within a few days,
unless food and help should come at once. The loading
of provisions was then rapidly completed. The day
before setting sail, the King of Sicily asked Tirant to
permit him to embark on his boat, for he, too, wished
to go to Jerusalem. Tirant was delighted to have him
as companion on the voyage. Finally they set sail,
and in four days crossed the Gulf of Venice and were
in sight of Rhodes. They directed the vessel to the
Castle of Saint Peter, and there anchored to await favorable
winds and weather. When the desired winds came
up, they again set sail. They started during the night,
and at dawn were very near the city of Rhodes. When
the hostile fleet saw the ship coming, they thought it
was one of theirs. They soon discovered their mistake,
but it was too late. They were not able to stop the ship,
which, with all sails unfurled, was dashing towards the
castle. It succeeded in reaching its destination, and
when the Knights of St. John saw it, and noticed its
strange banner, they knew it must be a ship that had
come to bring them relief. The provisions were soon
unloaded and the knights felt certain that, for some time
at least, starvation could not compel them to surrender.
(Chap. 104)</p>

<p>The Grand Master sent samples of the provisions to
the Sultan to show him that they had food to spare.
A mariner with great cunning and skill succeeded in
setting fire to the ship of the captain who was in command
of the hostile fleet, and the conflagration caused
consternation among the foe. The rainy season set
in, and the cold days of winter were near at hand.
On account of these things, the Sultan gave orders to
raise the siege, saying however that he would return
the following year. The unfortunate Sultan, when he arrived
at home, was accused of cowardice by his vassals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and thrown in the house of the lions, where he met a
horrible death. When the people of Cyprus heard that
the siege had been raised, many vessels laden with all
kinds of provisions sailed from Famagosta to the city
of Rhodes. Never before had such abundance of food
and supplies come to this place. (Chaps. 104-107)</p>

<p>A few days after the raising of the siege, two Venetian
galleys arrived at the city of Rhodes. They were carrying
pilgrims to Jerusalem. Tirant, the King of Sicily,
and Philip made arrangements to make their voyage
to the Holy City in one of these galleys. The Grand
Master wished to reward Tirant for the timely relief
that he had brought, but our hero would accept payment
neither for the vessel nor for the provisions. The
honor that he had won was sufficient reward for him.
When the Venetian galleys resumed their voyage, Tirant,
the king, Philip, and Diaphebus were among the passengers.
They landed at Jaffa and afterwards at Beirut.
At the latter place the pilgrims disembarked and made
their way to Jerusalem, where they remained for two
weeks. After having visited all the holy places, they
went to Alexandria. One day, while Tirant and the
king were walking through the city, they came upon
a wretched Christian captive. Tirant went to the owner
of the poor slave and paid him the ransom demanded.
Then he had it announced throughout the city that all
those who held Christian slaves would recover ransom
if they brought them to the inn where he was staying.
In two days he ransomed four hundred and seventy eight
captives, and took all of them with him to the
city of Rhodes, where he gave them new garments.
The discarded clothes he sent to Brittany, in order that,
after his death, they might be hung in the chapel with
the shields of the knights that he had vanquished in
England. He told the liberated slaves that they were
welcome to follow him, but if they preferred to stay in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Rhodes, or wished to go elsewhere, they were free to do
so. He gave them money, and they, in their great joy,
threw themselves at his feet, kissing these and then his
hands. From Rhodes, Tirant and his royal companions
sailed directly for Sicily, where they arrived a few
days later. (Chaps. 107-109)</p>

<p>When the king landed, he found waiting for him forty
knights who had come as ambassadors from the King
of France. They gave him a letter from their royal
master, in which the latter expressed his approval
of the proposed marriage of Philip and Ricomana.
Shortly afterwards the nuptials of the youngest son of
the King of France with the only daughter of the King
of Sicily were celebrated in great solemnity and splendor.
The festivities, which consisted of tournaments, jousting,
dances, and other forms of entertainment, continued for
a whole week. (Chaps. 109-111)</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III
<br />
<small>TIRANT JOINS THE EXPEDITION OF THE KING OF FRANCE
AGAINST THE INFIDELS</small></h3>


<p>In the letter which was brought by the ambassadors,
the King of France announced that he was going to make
war against the infidels, and asked the King of Sicily to
join him in the holy enterprise. The latter, accordingly,
after the festivities connected with the marriage were
over, fitted out two galleys and four other vessels and
placed them under the command of Philip. (Chap. 112)</p>

<p>The fleets of the kings of France, Castile, Aragon,
Navarre, Portugal, and Sicily, and those of the Pope and
of the Emperor, all met at the island of Corsica. Tirant
joined the expedition in a galley of his own, for he wished
to have a free hand. The united fleet set sail, and one
morning at dawn it arrived before the large city of Tripoli
in Syria. Tirant went before the French king and made
the vow that he would be the first to step on land and
the last one to return on board. Among the knights
there were many who were envious of Tirant, and they
were eager to make him break his vow. When the
men from the different vessels were about to land, Tirant
gave orders to his mariners to drive the galley at full
speed until it struck ground. He stood in the bow of
the vessel all armed, and the moment it touched land he
jumped into the water. The Moors immediately rushed
upon him, but Diaphebus and others quickly gathered
about him and drove them back. The Christians were
able to enter the city, but they found the enemy there
in such large numbers that they were obliged to return
to their ships. Tirant and another valiant knight,
Ricart lo Venturos, were the last ones to embark. They
had a lively dispute as to who should be the very last.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Finally, Ricart consented to embark before Tirant, if
the latter should put his foot on the ladder first. And
in this way Tirant fulfilled his vow, for which he was
highly honored. Ricart, however, was angry and sullen,
and challenged our hero to mortal combat. The latter,
incensed at this act of insolence, slapped the challenger,
and only the presence of the king was able to prevent
bloodshed. (Chaps. 112-114)</p>

<p>The fleet then went along the Turkish coast, plundering
and devastating. It sailed in the direction of Cyprus,
landed at Famagosta a short time afterwards, and with
replenished supply of provisions, sailed for Tunis. In
the attack on that city Tirant and his men tried to capture
a tower, in front of which there was a deep ditch.
Our hero had the misfortune to fall into it. He would
undoubtedly have been slain, had not Ricart come to his
rescue. The latter, however, warned him to be on the
alert, for it was his purpose to kill him. If he saved him,
it was because he did not wish to see the infidels slay
him. Tirant was deeply moved by this unexpected conduct
of his rival, and he threw himself at his feet
and asked his pardon for having offended him. Ricart,
touched by the humility of Tirant, forgave him, and
they became inseparable friends until they were parted
by death. (Chap. 114)</p>

<p>After the capture of Tunis, the fleet sailed for Sicily,
where the ships were provided with a new supply of provisions;
thence along the coast of Barbary and through
the Strait of Gibraltar; then, turning, it made its way
to Marseilles, where the King of France dismissed all the
ships except his own and those of Philip. The latter
went to see his mother, and Tirant made a visit to his
parents in Brittany. When the time came for Philip to
return to Sicily, he asked the king to persuade Tirant
to go with him. And thus it was that Tirant returned
to Sicily. (Chap. 114)</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV
<br />
<small>TIRANT ENTERS THE SERVICE OF THE EMPEROR
OF CONSTANTINOPLE</small></h3>


<p>Tirant had been back in Sicily only a week when
the king called him into his presence and read to him
a letter which he had received from the Emperor of Constantinople.
In this letter the emperor described the
sad state of affairs in the empire, and he begged the king
to ask Tirant to come to his assistance. Tirant was
pleased to go, since it was the king’s wish that he should.
The ruler of Sicily ordered eleven ships to be fitted out
and provided with all things necessary for the expedition.
When all was ready Tirant sailed for Constantinople
with his small fleet, and on his arrival the gloom of the
city was changed to joy. Tirant, Diaphebus, Ricart,
together with the other knights, disembarked and went
to the emperor to do him homage. His Imperial Majesty
immediately appointed Tirant Commander-in-chief
of his army, and Administrator of Justice. The latter
wished to decline these high positions, but finally accepted
them to please the emperor. Heralds then proclaimed
throughout the city that Tirant lo Blanch was appointed
Capita Major by His Imperial Majesty. When Tirant
went to pay his respects to the empress and the infanta,
he found them dressed in mourning and afflicted with
great grief, for the prince, the only son of the emperor,
had recently fallen in battle. He suggested that in order
to give courage to the people, and to inspire them with
confidence in regard to the final outcome of the war
with the Moors, gloom and despair ought to give way to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
hope and cheerfulness. The emperor immediately ordered
the court to cease its mourning. (Chaps. 115-117)</p>

<p>When Tirant beheld the charming princess, it must
be said that his eyes had never had such a feast. He
confided to Ricart how much he admired the wonderful
beauties of the palace, but more than all these he admired
the beauty of the princess, Carmesina. After taking
leave of the imperial family, he retired to the abode
which had been prepared for him. He entered a room
and rested his head on a cushion at the foot of the bed.
Soon afterwards he was invited to eat, but he answered
that he had pains in his head and did not wish to eat—he
was really wounded by that passion that deceives so
many. Diaphebus came and asked what was ailing
him, to which he answered that it was an ailment caused
by the air of the sea, but a moment later, he turned his
face from his friend and said: “I am in love.” Tears
began to flow from his eyes, and he sighed and sobbed.
Becoming somewhat ashamed of himself, he arose and
went to dinner, but could not eat. (Chaps. 117-119)</p>

<p>Diaphebus and another knight went to the palace and
were welcomed by the imperial family and the ladies of
the court. He announced that Tirant was indisposed,
whereupon doctors were immediately sent to attend
him. They returned a little later, and reported that the
slight indisposition was due to change of climate. At
the request of the emperor, Diaphebus gave an account
of the festivities connected with the General Court of
the King of England. He told of the great deeds of
Tirant, and showed them the document signed by the
King of England, in which Tirant lo Blanch was proclaimed
the best knight. All those who heard of the
hero’s exploits were filled with admiration for him.
When Diaphebus and Carmesina were a little apart
from the others, she questioned him concerning Tirant,
and Diaphebus told her that Tirant had come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Constantinople for no other reason than to see and to
serve her, for he had heard much concerning her beauty
and her excellent qualities. Upon hearing these words,
her cheeks became suffused with blushes, and she could
not say a word. (Chap. 119)</p>

<p>This interview with Diaphebus left the princess in
a pensive mood. The daughter of the late Duke of
Macedonia, Stephania, brought up with Carmesina and
of the same age, was one of her dearest friends. The
princess told her about the conversation with Diaphebus,
and confided to her that her heart was much inclined
to obey all the wishes and commands of Tirant. Stephania
encouraged her by saying that there was no lady
in the world who would not be pleased to be loved by
such a one as he. Carmesina did not sleep that night.
When Tirant saw the princess again, her beauty charmed
him even more than at first, and he became really lovesick.
Diaphebus consoled him as best he could, and
promised to do all in his power to advance his interests
with regard to Carmesina. (Chaps. 119-121)</p>

<p>One day, at a meeting of the General Council, Tirant
was requested to make ready to go against the Genoese,
who were coming in great numbers. At this session of
the Council it came to light that there was some opposition
to the newly appointed Capita Major, for one of
the members protested that the Duke of Macedonia,
who was still acting as Commander-in-chief, should not
be superseded, and especially not by a foreigner. The
aged emperor grew very angry when he heard these
words, and declared that the Duke of Macedonia was
a coward and had never won a battle. He further declared
that he himself would choose the Capita Major,
and that those who opposed his wishes in the matter
should be punished in such manner as would never be
forgotten. Then he gave orders that a proclamation
be made throughout the city instructing all those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
had grievances to appear before the imperial tribunal,
where their complaints would be given due consideration.
The following day Tirant, the imperial judge, heard
complaints and administered justice. (Chaps. 122-124)</p>

<p>The new Commander soon occupied himself with his
military duties. He reorganized the guards who watched
over the emperor, and made many innovations that
contributed to the general order and security of the city.
He took charge of the food supply and caused it to be
evenly distributed among the inhabitants. (Chap. 124)</p>

<p>One day the princess sent for him. She warned him
to beware of the Duke of Macedonia, who was very adroit
in committing acts of treachery. She related how he
had cut the thongs of the helmet of her brother while
the latter was bravely fighting the Moors, so that it
fell from his head and he was easily slain. Indeed,
the duke was the very incarnation of all the seven
mortal sins. (Chap. 125)</p>

<p>Tirant was happy sometimes, but more often he was
sad. His conduct and his speech revealed that something
was preying on his mind. His was the lot of the
uncertain lover, swaying between hope and fear. One
day Carmesina asked him why he was so sad. He answered
that he was in love. Then she requested him
to tell her who the lady was that caused him so much
anxiety. As an answer, he took something out of his
sleeve and handed it to the princess with these words:
“The image that you will see there can make me die or
live.” She took the object, went to her room, and looked
at it. Instead of the painted picture that she expected
to find, she saw an image of herself, for the object was
a precious and beautiful mirror. Carmesina admired
greatly this novel manner of making a confession of love.
While she was in her room, Viuda Reposada, who had
been the nurse of the princess and still had much influence
over her, entered the room, and with her came Stephania.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
They saw the mirror and inquired how it came into her
hands. She told them all about it. Viuda Reposada
then reproached her for being on such intimate terms
with one who was no more than her father’s servant.
She denounced the whole affair as absolutely improper.
The princess was very much affected by this harsh rebuke
and, on the verge of weeping, she retired to her
private chamber. Stephania followed and tried to console
her. (Chaps. 126-127)</p>

<p>The next day Tirant sent Diaphebus to see the princess,
in order to find out how she felt disposed towards him
since the mirror episode. When he began to speak to
her about Tirant, she exclaimed: “Oh! if you knew of
the trick that he played on me; with a mirror he made
a confession of love to me; just let me see him and
I shall tell him things that he will not care to hear.”
(Chap. 127)</p>

<p>The next time that Tirant saw her, she received him
coldly, and rebuked him severely, charging him with
being untrue to the trust imposed upon him; ungrateful
and disrespectful to the emperor, her father; and insolent
towards her, because he made a confession of love to her
as one would to a woman of low degree. Tirant answered
that he would avenge the insult by taking his
own life. He hastened to his abode. Immediately upon
his departure, she became sorry that she had spoken to
him so severely, and fearing that in his despair he might
do himself harm, sent Stephania to beg him to forgive
her, and by no means to take his life. She was so afraid
that Stephania might fail in her mission, that she herself
went to Tirant, expressed her sorrow for what she had
said, and humbly asked pardon. Tirant was deeply
moved by the love that her words and actions revealed,
and his woe was changed to joy. (Chaps. 127-130)</p>

<p>Bad news came from the imperial forces that were
in the field opposing the Moors. Under the leadership<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
of the Duke of Macedonia, they had again suffered
defeat, and were obliged to seek refuge in a city not far
away from the place where the battle was fought. The
Moors followed and besieged the city. The provisions
in it were almost exhausted, and unless relief came from
Constantinople within a very short time, the besieged
forces would be compelled to surrender. When Tirant
heard this, he made preparations to lead a relief expedition
to the threatened city within six days. (Chaps.
130-131)</p>

<p>Five days afterward there was a review of all the
troops within Constantinople, and on the morning of the
sixth day the banners were blessed, and all the soldiers
armed themselves and mounted their steeds. A knight
whose name was Fontsequa, and who was riding a large
and beautiful snow-white charger, carried the imperial
banner and led the assembled host as it marched out of
the city. Many dukes, marquises, earls, viscounts, and
other leaders were in this impressive military parade,
all with their squadrons. The last division to march out
was Tirant’s. (Chap. 132)</p>

<p>Our hero, the newly appointed Capita Major, was in
command of all these troops. The expedition moved
along in perfect order. Tirant’s wonderful sense of
organization and his ability to cope with any and all
difficulties were not long in revealing themselves. His
army arrived at the city of Pelidas, which was only a
league and a half from the camp of the Turks who were
besieging the city in which the forces of the Duke of
Macedonia had sought refuge. The sultan and the Grand
Turk, who were in command of the troops of the enemy,
knew that a Greek army had entered Pelidas, but they
were little concerned, for of the ten parts of the emperor’s
dominion they already held nine and one-half parts.
All that was necessary for them to do to become the
undisputed masters of the whole empire was to capture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the duke’s besieged forces and then take Constantinople.
In view of their vastly superior numbers, they felt confident
that the complete conquest of the Greek empire
was near at hand. (Chap. 133)</p>

<p>After Tirant had carefully observed the lay of the land
and the disposition of the hostile forces, he prepared
his plan of attack. In the darkness of night he led his
troops out of Pelidas, all ready for battle. A large
number of mares brought from Constantinople were
quietly led to the camp of the Turks, and when the
steeds of the latter heard them, they broke loose and ran
towards them. The whole camp was thrown into confusion.
The Turks, unarmed, went to look after their horses,
and were met by the Greeks, who slaughtered them in
great numbers and put the rest to flight. (Chap. 133)</p>

<p>The loud tumult occasioned by the fighting was heard
by the duke in the besieged city. Thinking that the
enemy was about to attack the place, he ordered all his
men to take up their arms and defend the city. At
daybreak he was surprised to see imperial banners outside
the city walls, and soldiers in pursuit of the fleeing Turks.
He then came out with his men and plundered the deserted
tents of the enemy. They found there a large
quantity of gold, silver, and jewels. They took the
booty into the city and hid it, then came out again and
rode towards the imperial banners. When Tirant saw
them, he rode in their direction, and on approaching
the duke, dismounted and showed him great respect and
honor. But the latter only raised his hand to his head.
He spoke not a word. All the kind and deferential
words and actions of our hero were met with scorn and
contempt. (Chap. 133)</p>

<p>When Tirant sent ambassadors to the duke to ask
him to give an account of the booty taken from the camp
of the Turks, the latter refused to do so, and he bade
the messengers tell the foreigner, Tirant, to return to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
his country, and if he did not do so, he would make
him drink so much water that half of the amount would
be too much. This speech was bitterly resented by
Tirant’s men. A battle between the forces of the two
leaders was imminent, but was averted by the calmness
and prudence of our hero. (Chap. 134)</p>

<p>Immediately after the victory over the Turks, Diaphebus
had sent a messenger to the emperor to announce
the glad tidings. The good news was then proclaimed
throughout the city, all the bells were rung, and the
inhabitants went to the Church of Saint Sophia to render
thanks unto the Lord for the great victory. (Chap. 134)</p>

<p>In the meantime, Armini, the Grand Sultan of Babylon,
sent three ambassadors to Tirant to ask for a truce
of six months, and also for the liberation of a youth who
was a brother of the sultan’s wife. The generosity and
magnanimity of our hero led him to set free the youthful
prisoner of war, and with him forty others. But the
truce was not granted, for it was the opinion of Tirant
and his Council that permanent peace could be secured
only by vanquishing the infidel host. (Chaps. 135-138)</p>

<p>On the same day that the ambassadors left the camp
of Tirant, he sent Diaphebus to Constantinople to deliver
to the emperor the large number of prisoners captured
in the first battle with the enemy. This gave Diaphebus
an excellent opportunity to speak to his dearly loved
Stephania and to the princess. He told the latter that
Tirant was always thinking of her, and that whenever
he went into battle, the name of Carmesina was on his
lips. And Stephania suggested that there was no one
more worthy and better qualified to be the next emperor
than Tirant, and he ought to be the husband of the
princess. As for herself, she confided to Carmesina, she
would marry his kinsman, Diaphebus. (Chap. 138)</p>

<p>While Tirant was storming a strongly fortified city,
held by the Turks, two thousand soldiers, under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
command of the Prior of St. John, joined him and placed
themselves under his direction. These had been sent
by the Grand Master of the Knights of St. John from
Rhodes. They assisted in the plundering of the city,
for a breach had already been made in the walls of the
place when they arrived. (Chap. 139)</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the Turks had received reinforcements
in great numbers. They encamped on one side
of a river, and the imperial forces on the other side.
About a league farther up the river there was a stone
bridge held by a faithful subject of the emperor. It was
protected by a castle at each one of the approaches, so
that the Turks were unable to cross over it. One of
these castles was guarded by the knight Mal Vehi, and
the other by his son, Hypolite (Hippolyte). The latter
was a bold and valiant youth, who soon became an enthusiastic
admirer of Tirant. At the earnest request of
both father and son, our hero conferred the honors of
knighthood upon Hypolite. (Chap. 140)</p>

<p>The Turks began to construct a bridge in order that
they might cross the river to attack the Greek forces.
When Tirant saw this, he ordered his men to build a
considerable number of boats. These were then fastened
together, and upon them was erected a framework
to support a large quantity of light and inflammable
wood. When this peculiar construction was completed,
it was fastened to the stone bridge and “camouflaged”
with branches so that the enemy might not see it.
(Chap. 140)</p>

<p>As soon as the Turks had finished their wooden bridge,
they crossed over it. As they were coming over, Tirant
led his forces up to the stone bridge. By the time that
the enemy arrived there, the Greeks were already on the
other side, and the passage over the bridge was closed.
Then the Turks went back over their bridge to the other
side, whereupon Tirant crossed back over the stone bridge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
These maneuvers continued for three days. Finally
the Moors decided to divide their forces, and that was
exactly what Tirant desired them to do. When one of
the divisions came over, the Greeks went up a mountain
near the wooden bridge. Since it was growing dark,
the Turks decided to stop at the foot of the mountain
and make an attack the next morning. In the darkness
of the night, Tirant sent the floating construction
down the stream, and it was set on fire just before it
reached the wooden bridge. When the Turks who had
crossed saw the fire and realized that their bridge would
be destroyed, they became panic-stricken and rushed
wildly to return to the other side of the river. In the
disorder and confusion many were pushed off the bridge
and were drowned. Twenty-two thousand of them were
unable to get back, and these surrendered to Tirant the
next morning. (Chaps. 140-141)</p>

<p>In the meantime the Duke of Macedonia had sent
a messenger to Constantinople to report to the emperor
that the vile foreigner, Tirant lo Blanch, had led the
whole army to destruction and had fled no one knew
whither. The false news plunged the aged emperor
into gloom and dejection, and the whole city was filled
with weeping and lamentation. (Chap. 141)</p>

<p>As soon as those of the Turks who had not been able
to rejoin the main body of the army surrendered, Diaphebus
again sent a messenger to the imperial city to announce
the successful event. But when he arrived there,
the emperor would not receive him. Finally he succeeded
in delivering the message to the princess. She immediately
reported it to her father, who fell unconscious from
excess of joy. And again all the bells of the city were
rung, and thanks were offered up to God. (Chap. 141)</p>

<p>The Constable and Diaphebus took the prisoners to
Constantinople. In recounting the exploits of Tirant
in the field, the Constable gave unlimited praise to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
young Capita Major. Diaphebus naturally made an effort
to see the princess and Stephania, and not without success.
The words he spoke to Carmesina increased greatly her
admiration for Tirant. His own love affair made wonderful
progress during this visit. (Chaps. 144-148)</p>

<p>The Turks, having lost one hundred thousand men
since Tirant became the leader of the imperial army,
held a council, in which it was decreed that the foreign
captain, Tirant lo Blanch, must be slain. The King of
Egypt was designated as the one to accomplish this,
since he was the most skillful of them all in the use of
arms. The sultan himself said: “If this devil of a man
had not come from France, we should even now be in
the palace of Constantinople, and should already have
made a mosque of the beautiful church there. We shall
never be able to accomplish that, if this captain lives
much longer.” (Chaps. 148-149)</p>

<p>The King of Egypt accordingly challenged Tirant to
mortal combat. In the challenge this king stated that
he had made a vow to his lady-love that he would engage
in a <em>combat à outrance</em> with a king or a king’s son, or with
the best captain of the Christian army, and that it was
his intention to send her the head of Tirant to show that
his vow had been accomplished. He also suggested that
each one of them should champion the cause of a lady,
and then the combat should also determine which one
of these ladies excelled in beauty, dignity, virtue, lineage,
grace, and wisdom. The challenge and the suggestion
were accepted. It was agreed that the King of Egypt
should fight in behalf of his lady-love, the Grand Turk’s
daughter, and Tirant, in behalf of Carmesina, the emperor’s
daughter. The combat was to take place on the
field of battle, on August the twentieth, four days earlier,
or four days later. (Chaps. 149-152)</p>

<p>Tirant was making preparations for a supreme effort
to win a decisive victory over the enemy. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Duke of Macedonia was opposed to his plans, and, in
a speech full of bitter invectives, he declared that Tirant
had made a bargain with the Turks to deliver the Greeks
into their hands. He called him a second Judas, who,
on account of his treachery, ought to be thrown into
burning oil. He protested against the leadership of this
foreigner and declared that he would obey his orders
no longer. A great uproar followed this speech. Many
soldiers took up their arms, and some of them mounted
their steeds. In reply, Tirant denounced the duke for
never having won a single battle; he accused him of
having cut the thongs of the late prince’s helmet in the
thick of a battle, whereupon the heir of the empire was
slain; and he spoke of the great loss in lives and in territory
that the empire suffered while the duke was in
command of the armies. In the name of the emperor,
he asked them to prepare to attack the enemy. But
the duke replied that neither he nor any of his men would
take part in the proposed attack. (Chaps. 153-154)</p>

<p>The following day the council of war met, and Tirant
suggested that a new leader should be selected. He
assured the members that he would remain with them
to serve His Imperial Majesty. But they would not
hear of this. In strong language they expressed their
confidence in him. (Chap. 154)</p>

<p>It was at this time that some more foreign soldiers
came to place themselves under the command of Tirant.
Philip, the son of the King of France, had become King
of Sicily, and in grateful memory he sent five thousand
men under the leadership of the Duke of Messina, and
Queen Ricomana sent two thousand under the leadership
of the Senyor de Pantalea. (Chap. 154)</p>

<p>When the emperor heard of the quarrel between the
duke and Tirant, he went to the camp to settle the
dispute once for all. The princess accompanied him,
and with her went Stephania, Viuda Reposada, Plaer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
de mi Vida, and other ladies of the court. While they
were in camp, the greatest battle of all that had been
fought up to this time took place. It was waged fiercely
on both sides, from early in the morning until late in
the afternoon. The contending foes fought with determination
and desperation. Tirant wielded his battle-ax
wherever help seemed to be needed most. The King
of Egypt recognized him on the field, and he, together
with the King of Cappadocia and the King of Africa,
agreed to make it their special duty to slay him that day.
While Tirant was in the midst of violent fighting, the
Duke of Macedonia came up behind him and with a
vigorous blow of his sword wounded him in the neck.
A few moments later the King of Cappadocia and the
King of Egypt suddenly came upon our hero, and they
attacked him with such force that both he and his steed
fell. He had some difficulty in getting up, for his charger
had fallen on one of his legs, but fortunately one of his
men came to the rescue. The latter, with his lance,
wounded the King of Egypt in the thigh. A moment
later the king’s lance struck Tirant on his cheek and
knocked out four of his teeth. Then the king withdrew
from the field on account of his wound. Tirant searched
for him, but in vain. He met, however, the King of
Cappadocia and slew him. Finally, the sultan, seeing
that the tide of battle was going against him, withdrew
from the battlefield, and soon afterward the Turks were
put to flight. Tirant and his forces pursued them and
continued to slaughter many until it was very late. The
sultan and his defeated army sought refuge in a certain
city, and this was taken by Tirant’s forces the following
morning. Among the many prisoners captured there,
was the King of Egypt. Tirant was notified that this
important royal personage was a prisoner, and was invited
to come to slay him, but he replied that for nothing in
the world would he take the life of a prisoner. Thereupon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the Marquis of Saint George dispatched the unfortunate
king. In this battle and pursuit the Turks lost
103,000 men, including those who were taken prisoners.
Among the Greeks that were slain were the Duke of
Macedonia and the Constable. The brave Ricart, too,
was among the dead. A messenger announced the result
of the battle to the emperor, and immediately the venerable
monarch knelt down and offered thanks to Christ
and His Most Blessed Mother, Our Lady. (Chaps.
155-158)</p>

<p>After this disastrous defeat of the Moors, the sultan
and all the men who had been able to escape with him
found refuge in the city of Bellpuig, which was four leagues
distant from that in which the King of Egypt was slain.
The imperial forces did not attack the sultan’s army,
but confined their operations for the time to recapturing
some of the other places that had recently been taken
by the enemy. The emperor accompanied the troops
from Sicily, who succeeded in recovering several cities.
(Chap. 159)</p>

<p>After the emperor’s return to the castle of Mal Vehi,
where he lived during his visit to the camp, he asked
Tirant to recommend some one to fill the vacancy caused
by the death of the Constable. The name of Diaphebus
was suggested. And it was the pleasure of the emperor
to appoint Diaphebus Constable of the Empire. Then he
turned to Tirant and said: “And you I shall make the
Earl of Sent Angel.” But Tirant declined the honor, and
this greatly displeased His Majesty. And the Capita
Major, not wishing to wound the feelings of the aged
monarch, said that since whatever belonged to Diaphebus
was his, and whatever was his belonged to Diaphebus,
he would accept the earldom, but that the title should
be bestowed on his friend, the newly appointed Constable.
The princess was very curious to know why he would
not accept the title, and in his reply to her question,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
he told her that he would never accept any title as long
as he lived except that of emperor—either that or none.
(Chap. 161)</p>

<p>The appointment of Diaphebus as Constable, and his
elevation to the dignity of Earl of Sent Angel, were celebrated
with great splendor. But Tirant was sad during
the festivities. The princess noticed this, and she asked
what grieved him so. He answered that he was filled
with sorrow because she was about to return to Constantinople.
Carmesina told this to Stephania, and they
invited Tirant and Diaphebus to visit them secretly
that night. When the visitors came, all the attendants
and companions of the princess were asleep, with the
exception of Plaer de mi Vida, who was wide awake with
curiosity, although she pretended to be sleeping. She
heard and saw all that happened, and the next morning
she told Carmesina and Stephania that she had had a
wonderful dream during the night. Being asked to
relate it, she told all about the secret visit of Tirant and
Diaphebus. And then she added, with a sigh, that she
regretted deeply that Hypolite and she had not been
invited to the party. (Chaps. 162-163)</p>

<p>That same day the emperor and all who had come
with him returned to Constantinople. The heart of the
princess was heavy when the time came for her to leave
Tirant. She veiled her face in order that no one might
see her tears. (Chap. 163)</p>

<p>Five large ships arrived at a port which was at a considerable
distance from the camp of the imperial army,
and these were laden with provisions for that army.
Tirant placed the camp under the command of the Constable
and went to see about the unloading of the ships.
The owners of these vessels and the mariners were delighted
to see the great Captain. They informed him that seven
Genoese ships had entered the port of Bellpuig with
provisions for the sultan’s army. Tirant remarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
that he would do all in his power to eat some of those
provisions. As soon as all the vessels were unloaded,
Tirant embarked with a large number of armed men,
and, in the darkness of night, started out for the port of
Bellpuig. They arrived there early the following morning,
and, with little difficulty, captured the ships. The
provisions were sent to the camp of the Greek army.
(Chap. 163)</p>

<p>From the prisoners taken in this venture, Tirant learned
that the Grand Caramany and the King of Upper India
were on their way to join the sultan. They were coming
with fifty thousand men. Following the advice of one
of the prisoners, and aided by the men from the island
of Rhodes, who were well-trained in seafaring, Tirant
prepared a formidable fleet and waited for the arrival
of the Moorish reinforcements. Finally the expected fleet
came in sight, and Tirant’s vessels went out to meet
it. The hostile fleet was dispersed, and after a long
chase and a terrible fight, Tirant’s ship captured the
vessel which bore the Grand Caramany and the King
of Upper India. Our hero, in person, took the royal
prisoners to Constantinople and delivered them to the
emperor. This naval victory caused great rejoicing in
the imperial city. The inhabitants came out to greet
and honor their invincible Captain. They fixed their
eyes upon him as if he had been sent to them from heaven.
(Chaps. 163-166)</p>

<p>Tirant had been severely wounded in the sea fight,
and the emperor’s physicians ordered him to remain in
bed until his wounds were healed, for there was great
danger that he might be permanently maimed. During
the period of his recovery the imperial family visited him
daily, and Viuda Reposada, moved more by love than
piety, was his faithful and devoted attendant. (Chap. 166)</p>

<p>During his absence from the camp the imperial army
was faring badly. The Turks won two great victories, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
as a result the Greeks lost their courage and their confidence.
They offered up special prayers for the rapid
recovery of their valiant Captain. Without him, they
considered their cause lost. They sent him a letter in
which they declared that they would fight no more battles
until he had rejoined them. While he was waiting for
his wounds to heal, his martial spirit seemed to desert
him. Carmesina noticed this, and, in one of their private
conversations, said to him: “Cease to be a lover,
and win honors; I do not say that you should cease to
be a lover altogether, for in times of peace men take
great delight in loving, but in time of war men are obliged
to undergo much toil and many hardships.” (Chaps.
166-172)</p>

<p>When Tirant was about to return to the camp, the
sultan sent ambassadors to the emperor. Their mission
was concerned with three things: first, a truce for three
months; secondly, ransom of the Grand Caramany and
the King of Upper India; and thirdly, an agreement
whereby the emperor’s daughter should be given in
marriage to the sultan, in consideration whereof all the
cities and territory captured by the Turks should be
restored to the emperor. (Chaps. 177-178)</p>

<p>Many of the members of the Imperial Council were in
favor of the proposed marriage for the sake of the peace
that would follow. Tirant’s heart was filled with fear
and anxiety at this state of affairs. The princess consoled
him with the following words: “How can you
believe that my royal person will submit to a Moor?
How can you even imagine that my noble heart will
condescend to become the friend of one of those Moorish
dogs, who have as many women as they wish, and none
of these a wife, for they can leave them any hour that
they wish.” (Chaps. 178-179)</p>

<p>A great festival was arranged in honor of the Moorish
ambassadors. The celebration lasted nine days. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the very last day a large number of galleys were observed
coming towards the shore. They were French ships
bringing five thousand “francs archers,” and each of
these archers was accompanied by a squire and a page.
They were coming to enter the service of the emperor.
The galleys had been fitted out and furnished with provisions
by the King of France. Tirant’s cousin, the
Viscount of Branches, was in command of these soldiers.
Our hero warmly welcomed him and all those who had
come with him. The emperor was delighted at their
coming, and his pleasure was considerably increased
by the fact that the Moorish ambassadors had witnessed
the arrival of these foreign warriors. (Chap. 189)</p>

<p>At the close of these festivities the emperor gave his
answer to the ambassadors in regard to the ransom of
the royal prisoners and the marriage of the princess to
the sultan, the proposal of the truce having been accepted
immediately after the Turkish representatives
had announced their mission. He bade them tell the
sultan that the emperor of Constantinople would not
liberate the Grand Caramany and the King of Upper
India until the empire had been wholly restored; and
that he would not give his daughter in marriage to a
man who was not of the Christian faith, for that would
be against the precepts of the Holy Catholic Church.
(Chaps. 207-208)</p>

<p>While the truce was in effect, Tirant remained in the
imperial city. He pretended to be occupied with military
matters, but, in reality, his mind was centered upon
Carmesina. His one dominant purpose was to obtain
from the princess the “compliment de amor.” He made
strong and repeated efforts to attain his end, but she was
firm. She loved him with all her heart, but she would
not sacrifice her honor. Tirant had helpful allies in
Plaer de mi Vida, Stephania, and Hypolite, but their
arguments, plans, and schemes availed him naught.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Carmesina was young and in love with him whom she
considered the only person that could save the empire.
She was human and could not force herself to forbid
him to approach her. The temptations to fall were
strong, but her religious training and her moral courage
sustained her in the hour of need. (Chaps. 208-215)</p>

<p>Viuda Reposada, whose affectionate and passionate
advances to Tirant had always been met with scorn,
was burning with unrequited love and jealousy. She
determined to make a desperate effort to sever the bond
of love that existed between Tirant and the princess.
To accomplish this she told Carmesina base lies about
her lover, and advised her gradually to avoid meeting
him. As a result the heart of the princess was filled
with fear and torment. (Chap. 215)</p>

<p>A short time before the termination of the truce Diaphebus,
Constable and Earl of Sent Angel, was married to
Stephania. The wedding was celebrated with great
splendor. To add to the importance of the occasion,
he was appointed Duke of Macedonia. And Tirant and
his friends kissed the foot and the hand of the emperor,
and gave him infinite thanks for the great favor he
had shown them by giving his niece to their companion.
(Chaps. 219-222)</p>

<p>But while Diaphebus and Stephania were happy, and
all were making merry, the princess and Tirant were
downcast and wretched. Carmesina was following the advice
of Viuda Reposada. She avoided Tirant. He became
aware of this, and it tormented him. (Chap. 224)</p>

<p>Plaer de mi Vida was always ready and eager to help
Tirant. One night she led him into Carmesina’s chamber.
When the latter suddenly saw him beside her, she gave
a scream which caused great excitement in the palace.
Plaer de mi Vida helped him escape through a window
by means of a rope, but it was too short, and he was
obliged to let himself fall a distance of twelve yards.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
One of his legs was broken as a result of the fall. Fortunately,
Hypolite and the Viscount of Branches found
him, and they spread the report that Tirant’s steed had
fallen on his leg and broken it. The emperor sympathized
with his esteemed Captain in his misfortune. The accident
happened at an inopportune time, for the Moors had
received strong reinforcements. The aged monarch feared
that as long as Tirant was absent from the army, it would
not give a good account of itself. (Chaps. 225-238)</p>

<p>Hypolite remained at the court with Tirant, and gradually
a love affair began between him and the empress,
which finally resulted in an illicit liaison. He and
Plaer de mi Vida continued to act as intermediaries in
Tirant’s relations with the princess. One day Carmesina,
in order to prove her love for the Capita Major,
took his right hand in her own and spoke these words:
“I, Carmesina, give myself to you, Tirant lo Blanch,
as your faithful wife, and accept you as my loyal husband.”
Then she took a formal oath that she would
never leave him for any other man in the world, and that
she would always be true, faithful, and without blemish.
Great was Tirant’s joy when he heard these words, for
they gave him a feeling of assurance that in a short time
not only the princess, but also the imperial crown would
be his. And he, too, made a vow similar to the one
pronounced by Carmesina. (Chaps. 248-272)</p>

<p>After Tirant’s leg had completely mended, and when
he was ready to resume active command of the army
in the field, a great celebration was given in his honor.
The Imperial Council felt that he well deserved such
manifestation of respect and esteem, for in four and
one-half years he had recovered three hundred and
seventy-two cities, towns, and castles. (Chap. 275)</p>

<p>During Tirant’s absence from the camp the Duke of
Pera and Diaphebus were in command of the Greek
army. On account of a disagreement between the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
commanders, the whole imperial army suffered a disastrous
defeat, which plunged all Constantinople in grief.
Tirant made haste to rejoin his troops. Having decided
to go by sea instead of by land, he embarked. He informed
no one concerning his departure except those
who were to go with him. He did not take leave of
Carmesina, for jealous Viuda Reposada had carried out
a diabolical plot which shook Tirant’s faith in the purity
of the princess. When the latter heard that he had
embarked, she was disconsolate, and sent Plaer de mi
Vida to Tirant for the purpose of finding out why he had
not bidden her farewell. The messenger succeeded in
reaching the vessel on which Tirant was about to set
sail. The infamous plotting of Viuda Reposada was
discovered, and the Capita Major was sorry for having
permitted himself to be so basely deceived, and asked
Plaer de mi Vida to express his regret to the princess and
to beg her to pardon him. But suddenly a violent storm
came up, which drove the boat far out on the sea. Finally
the ship was wrecked off the coast of Barbary. Both
Tirant and Carmesina’s messenger succeeded in reaching
the shore, but not together. (Chaps. 286-299)</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V
<br />
<small>TIRANT CONQUERS ALL BARBARY</small></h3>


<p>Plaer de mi Vida fell into the hands of a Moor who
had been a captive in Spain for a long time. One day
this Moor had saved the life of a son of the lady whom he
was serving, and on account of this she set him free. In
grateful remembrance of that kindness, he was moved to
befriend the shipwrecked lady. He led her to his home
and placed her in the care of his daughter, whom he told
that the Christian woman was a daughter of the lady
who had freed him. The Moor’s daughter received her
and treated her with much kindness. (Chap. 299)</p>

<p>Tirant, upon reaching land, concealed himself in a cave
which happened to be in the territory of the King of
Tunis, Scariano. A short time before, this king had asked
the King of Tremicen to give him his daughter in marriage,
which the latter was unwilling to do, for she was
already married. In order to settle the affair in a friendly
manner, the King of Tremicen sent the chief officer of
his army as ambassador to the King of Tunis. The
ambassador went hunting one day and found Tirant in
the cave. He sent him secretly to one of his castles in
Tremicen, where he kept him as a prisoner for some time.
Finally the negotiations were discontinued, and the King
of Tunis, with 50,000 men, marched against the King of
Tremicen, who was not able to gather more than 20,000.
In the meantime the unsuccessful ambassador had returned
home and assumed command of the army of
Tremicen. He asked his Christian prisoner, Tirant,
to help in the defense of the kingdom. Our hero was
quite willing to do so, and soon his skill, bravery, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
strategies won for him great admiration and esteem.
As a reward for his valuable services, he was liberated,
but he remained in the service of the kingdom. The
King of Tremicen with his family, including the husband
of his daughter, had found refuge in the city of Tremicen.
But a treacherous Jew admitted the enemy in large numbers
into the strongly fortified city, and the king, his
sons, and his son-in-law were all slain. The daughter,
whose name was Maragdina, was taken to a castle, where
she was obliged to remain with Scariano, the King of
Tunis. This castle was soon afterwards captured through
the subtle stratagems of Tirant, and Scariano was made
prisoner. (Chaps. 299-318)</p>

<p>When Maragdina saw the fair, manly, and handsome
Tirant for the first time—which was some time before
her husband had been slain—she wished that her husband
were dead that she might be free to wed this wonderful
Christian. But now that he was dead, there was
still an obstacle; she was a Mohammedan, and Tirant
a Christian. She suggested to our hero that he become
a Mohammedan, but, she naïvely added, if he should
insist that his religion was better than hers, she would
very willingly believe it, and always say that it was better.
Tirant answered her that he was betrothed to another,
and that he must and would remain faithful to her.
He treated Maragdina with so much kindness and affection
that she finally asked him to baptize her. He sent
for a gold basin and a pitcher of water, and when these
had been brought to him, she came before him, knelt
down, uncovered her head, and received the sacrament
of baptism. (Chaps. 322-326)</p>

<p>When Scariano heard that Maragdina had accepted
the Christian faith, he, too, wished to be baptized. But
first he desired to be enlightened in regard to the doctrines
of that religion. Tirant confessed that he was
not too well versed in matters pertaining to the faith,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
but would nevertheless give him instruction. And he
did it so well that Scariano was surprised that a knight
could know so much concerning the Trinity, and declared
that the explanations given by him were more comprehensible
than those that he had once heard made by
certain monks when he was a youth. (Chaps. 326-327)</p>

<p>The baptism of Scariano took place in a beautiful
square of the city. Many of his officers and kinsmen
witnessed the ceremony, and they, too, were baptized.
Tirant administered the sacrament of baptism to more
than six thousand Moors that day. A monk of the Order
of Mercy came opportunely, and he was requested by
our hero to baptize the rest of those who wished to
become Christians. In all 44,327 Moors were baptized.
(Chaps. 329-330)</p>

<p>Several kings of Barbary, who were on their way with
many men to help Scariano, became indignant when
they heard that he had become a Christian, and they
took possession of the kingdom of Tunis and placed
another king over it. Thereupon Scariano withdrew
with his faithful subjects to Tremicen, the inhabitants
of which, following the example of their queen, Maragdina,
embraced the Christian faith. The queen made
another effort to induce Tirant to take her as his wife,
but was again unsuccessful. He spoke to her kindly,
reasoned with her, and finally persuaded her to marry
Scariano. The marriage ceremony was performed by the
monk, and thus Scariano became the King of Tremicen.
(Chaps. 330-333)</p>

<p>After the Moorish kings had subdued all the kingdom
of Tunis, they decided to make war against the kingdom
of Tremicen in order to exterminate the Christians.
Tirant then began to gather and organize an army which
was to defend Tremicen against the combined forces of
those kings. He won the admiration, confidence, and
love of the people, and as he passed through the streets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
they greeted him with the cheer: “Vixca lo magnanim
Capita crestia.” (Chap. 334)</p>

<p>Many bloody battles were fought during this war.
The enemy had ten times as many men, but Tirant’s
forces were never dismayed, although sometimes it seemed
as if the fortunes of war were against them. Tirant’s
military genius and his prowess were always in evidence.
Never was a lance handled more dexterously, nor a
battle-ax wielded more vigorously. He was ever in the
thick of the fray unless there was some special work
for him to do. Senyor Dagramunt, one of the shipwrecked
men who had succeeded in rejoining his great
Captain, and Scariano, too, performed many feats of
valor, and slew almost as many of the enemy as Tirant.
The Moorish kings could not understand how the Christians,
so few in numbers compared with their own, could
withstand them. They attributed the stubborn and
heroic defense of Tremicen to Tirant, and made up their
minds to slay him. But several of them met death in
the attempt. Finally, they asked for an armistice,
which was granted. While this was in effect, they withdrew
their forces and retired to their respective kingdoms.
The Christian kingdom of Tremicen had fought
for its existence, and its cause had triumphed. (Chaps.
333-349)</p>

<p>Tirant’s ambition now was to conquer all Barbary.
In order that the conquest might be accomplished as
rapidly as possible, Senyor Dagramunt set out with an
army to capture the cities, towns, and castles on the
other side of the mountains. The expedition met with
no serious opposition until it came to a city named Montagata,
which belonged to the daughter of a Moorish
king who had been slain in battle. When the inhabitants
of this place learned that the Christian army was
near, they sent the keys of the city to Senyor Dagramunt.
But when he arrived there, they had changed their minds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and preferred to die rather than surrender. The Christian
leader was extremely vexed by this turn of affairs,
and determined to take the city at all hazards. While
taking part in an attack on the fortifications, he was
painfully wounded. He sent a messenger to Tirant with
the request that he come to his aid with the heavy artillery.
When the latter arrived, the assault was renewed
with great violence. The inhabitants soon sent a number
of their most distinguished men to Senyor Dagramunt.
They offered to pay him a heavy tribute annually, if
he would spare the city and permit them to live in their
faith. The offer was rejected with scorn. Then the
Senyora of the city, accompanied by many maids of
honor, went out to placate the obdurate Christian commander,
but all her efforts were in vain. The failure
of these two attempts to save the city caused great fear
and distress in Montagata. (Chaps. 349-350)</p>

<p>Some time prior to this the Senyora had bought a
certain female slave on account of her great skill in
embroidering. When this slave learned that Tirant
and Senyor Dagramunt were in command of the Christian
forces, she asked permission to go out and plead
with them to spare the city. She spoke so confidently
of the success of her mission that her request was granted.
Disguising herself, she went to Tirant, and in long speeches
she pleaded for the inhabitants of Montagata. When
she finally told him the story of his life, he was mystified.
He begged her to tell him how it came that she knew
so much about him. When she answered that she was
Plaer de mi Vida, he threw himself on his knees before
her, and embraced and kissed her several times as a
sign of true love. Then Tirant immediately gave orders
that it be proclaimed that all the inhabitants were pardoned,
and that they would be permitted to profess and
practice the religion that they preferred. When the
keys of the city were delivered to him, he gave them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Plaer de mi Vida, who was led in triumphal procession
into the palace and made Senyora of Montagata. She
ruled over the city for a week and then abdicated in
favor of the former Senyora, who became a Christian
and all her subjects likewise. Tirant persuaded Plaer
de mi Vida to accept Senyor Dagramunt as husband,
and after their marriage he placed them as king and
queen over the conquered provinces of Fez and Bugia
[Bougie]. Tirant continued his victorious campaign
until finally there was but one city in all Barbary that
had not been captured. This was the city of Caramen,
in which three Moorish kings had taken refuge. He
sent ambassadors to request them to leave Caramen and
the soil of Barbary. The answer he received was one of
defiance. A great battle was fought in which the Moors
were defeated, and they went back into the strongly
fortified city, where they resisted the violent attacks
of the Christians for a whole year. But finally one
thousand of Tirant’s men succeeded in entering the city
by means of a mine, and these opened the city gates,
on the outside of which divisions of the Christian army
were waiting. These poured into the city and annihilated
the Moors. This was the last stand made by
the infidels against the victorious Christians. And now
Tirant’s purpose was accomplished; all Barbary was conquered.
(Chaps. 350-387, 394)</p>

<p>Some time prior to the capture of Caramen, Tirant
sent a messenger to Constantinople to inform the emperor
that, if the empire was still in need of aid, he would return
with 250,000 men, and that the King of Sicily would
probably join him with his army. The emperor received
the news with great delight. After delivering the message
to the imperial monarch, the messenger went to
a convent to which the princess had retired, and gave
her a letter from Tirant. She was speechless with emotion
upon learning that he was still alive. When the messenger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
returned to Tirant with communications from the
emperor and the princess, the great Captain learned that
the Moors had conquered the whole empire, with the
exception of the cities of Constantinople and Pera and
a few castles, and that Diaphebus and many of his friends
were prisoners. (Chaps. 388-393, 395-398)</p>

<p>At Constantine, in Tunis, Tirant gathered an army
of over 250,000 men, with which he hoped to drive the
Moorish invaders from the soil of the Greek empire.
He sent an agent to Genoa, Rome, and Venice to secure
ships to transport this vast army. The vessels arrived
at Constantine within a short time. But before these
forces embarked, Tirant assembled the people in a vast
plain and addressed them in a short speech. After his
address, a Catalan monk, John Ferrer, who was a native
of Lérida, and who spoke the Moorish tongue well, preached
to the multitude. After his sermon the people in loud
cries asked to be baptized, and in three days the monks
and chaplains whom Tirant had sent for baptized 334,000
men, women, and children. (Chaps. 401-407)</p>

<p>Throughout the period of the military conquest of
Barbary, Tirant built churches and monasteries for the
priests and monks who came thither in response to his
call. Mohammedanism had been dealt a deathblow,
and Christianity was firmly established in all Barbary.

<h3>CHAPTER VI
<br />
<small>TIRANT RETURNS TO CONSTANTINOPLE AND THE GREEK
EMPIRE IS COMPLETELY RESTORED</small></h3>


<p>Finally the huge army embarked and sailed for Sicily,
where it was joined by King Philip with his forces. Within
a few days the expedition arrived near Constantinople,
the port of which was blockaded by the Moorish fleet.
The army could not land until the hostile ships were
dispersed or captured. Tirant’s fleet attacked the
enemy at break of day, coming upon them so suddenly
that they could not make a strong resistance. Some
Moors leaped into the water and succeeded in reaching
the shore, but all those who remained on the vessels
were slain. Tirant took possession of all the boats of
the enemy. The troops of the sultan and the Grand
Turk were on the shore ready to attack the Christians
if these should attempt to land, so Tirant took his whole
fleet, together with the captured vessels, out to sea,
and when darkness fell he turned about, came back,
and landed at a very advantageous point only four
leagues distant from the Moorish army. The next day
the Moors saw themselves surrounded by an army vastly
superior to their own in numbers. The sultan and the
Grand Turk were in a quandary. Finally, they decided
to send ambassadors to Tirant to propose a treaty
of peace for a hundred and one years. In order to obtain
such a peace, they were willing to restore all the cities,
towns, and castles that they had conquered, and liberate
all prisoners. Tirant convened his council to consider
the proposal, and it was decided to refer the matter to
His Imperial Majesty. The affair was important, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Tirant himself went to consult the emperor about it.
(Chaps. 408-434)</p>

<p>What a welcome excuse it was to go to see the princess!
It was night when Tirant arrived at the palace,
and His Majesty had already retired. But he succeeded
in finding Plaer de mi Vida, who had come with the
expedition and had entered Constantinople almost immediately
after the landing of the troops. She quickly
arranged a meeting between the victorious Captain and
Carmesina, and that night the princess was overcome
with love. (Chaps. 434-436)</p>

<p>The following day he went to see the emperor. The
aged ruler could not withhold his tears, so great was the
joy he felt on seeing again the invincible Commander.
As soon as Tirant had informed him of the purpose of
his visit, the Imperial Council was convened, and after
mature deliberation it was decided to accept the proposal
of peace made by the enemy, but on the one condition
that the sultan and the Grand Turk, together with other
important Moorish chieftains, should give themselves
up as hostages until the whole empire should be completely
restored and the prisoners liberated. The condition
imposed by the emperor was accepted and the
treaty of peace was concluded. (Chaps. 440-447)</p>

<p>The sultan, the Grand Turk, and twenty other Moorish
lords surrendered to Tirant. He took them into the
imperial city, where he was received with rapturous
rejoicing and was acclaimed liberator of the empire.
The great host of the infidels was taken back to Turkey
by the imperial fleet, and then an elaborate reception
was given in honor of the King of Sicily, the King of
Fez and Bugia, Tirant, and others. The merrymaking
continued for a week. During this period Tirant frequently
saw the princess and he longed for the day when
their vows might be realized. (Chaps. 447-452)</p>

<p>In order to bring about the complete restoration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the empire as quickly as possible, Tirant asked the emperor
for permission to take formal possession of all the
places that were to be given back by the Moors. At
the same time he assured him that, if fortune should
not be against him, His Majesty should rule over all the
lands that had been under the dominion of his predecessor,
Justinian. The emperor, moved by the devotion
of his faithful Captain, and mindful of his past
services, offered to abdicate in his favor, but Tirant
would not consent to that. However, he expressed his
willingness to succeed him after his death. Then His
Imperial Majesty offered him the hand of Carmesina
and led him into her chamber. When he saw that both
of them seemed pleased at his suggestion, he sent for the
archbishop, and Tirant and Carmesina were betrothed.
This betrothal was celebrated with great pomp and
splendor. And the emperor ordered his heralds to
proclaim throughout the city that all should regard and
hold Tirant as his first-born son and Caesar of the Empire,
and that he should be their lord and emperor after his
death. The people in exultation gave answer to the
proclamation with the loud and enthusiastic cheers:
“Visca la celestial e angelica bondat del Emperador!
e Visca lo novell Cesar del Imperi grech, honor, manteniment,
y gloria.” (Chaps. 452-453)</p>

<p>Tirant, accompanied by two representatives of the
sultan and the Grand Turk, and provided with letters
of credence from these two Moorish chiefs, set out with
a large army to begin the work of restoring the empire.
It was not a difficult task. City after city was delivered
to him without a struggle. At Trebizond, Diaphebus
and many other prisoners of rank were liberated. Then
Tirant resumed his triumphant march until he had received
in behalf of the emperor all the territory that had
been taken by the Moors. He did more than this;
he conquered additional territory. He ordered the fleet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
to aid in the work, and it took possession of all the
islands that had formerly belonged to the empire. And
now the task that he had purposed to accomplish was
done. (Chaps. 444-466)</p>

<p>With his heart filled with joyful anticipations, he
started on his way back to Constantinople, where the
princess was eagerly awaiting him. When he arrived
at Adrianople he received word from the emperor to wait
there until sent for, because the monarch wished to
prepare a wonderful celebration on the occasion of the
triumphal entry of the Caesar of the Greek empire.
(Chap. 467)</p>

<p>While walking along the bank of a river near Adrianople
he was suddenly attacked by a severe pain in the
side. He was carried to the city, where physicians
immediately attended him, but they were unable to give
him any relief. Feeling that the hour of his death was
near, he called for a priest and made a careful and contrite
confession. When the sacred Host was presented
to him, tears came to his eyes, and with great devotion
he said several prayers. After he had received Holy
Communion, he asked for his secretary and made his
last will and testament. Then he asked to be carried
to Constantinople, for he believed that to see and to be
near Carmesina might save him. They placed him on
a litter and carried him as gently as possible towards
the imperial city. When they had covered about half
the distance, they were met by Diaphebus and Hypolite.
Tirant requested them to kiss him, for it would be their
last farewell. And they, in tears, kissed him, and while
they were addressing him with words of hope and cheer,
he suddenly cried out: “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy
on me!” A moment later, he added: “Jesus, into Thy
hands I commend my spirit.” And these were the last
words of Tirant lo Blanch, Caesar of the Greek empire.
(Chaps. 467-471)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>It was pitiful to bear the weeping and lamenting and
sobbing of those about him. When finally they were
able to master their grief, they carried his body into
Constantinople and had it embalmed. Then it was
clothed in imperial vestments and placed on a beautiful
catafalque in the Church of Saint Sophia. (Chap. 471)</p>

<p>When the emperor was informed of the death of Tirant
he staggered as from a blow, and spent that night in
lamenting and sobbing as if his heart would break. When
daylight came, he went to the church to do honor to the
fallen hero. (Chaps. 471-472)</p>

<p>When the princess saw all those about her weeping, she
wondered what had happened. One of her attendants
informed her that Tirant had passed from this life into
the other. Carmesina was stunned; she could neither
speak nor weep. After she had partially recovered from
the shock, she asked for the robe that she was to have
worn on her wedding-day; she put it on, and then, with
her attendants, hastened to the church. Having mounted
the catafalque, she threw herself upon the corpse of her
hero and lover. Tears were streaming from her eyes,
and they fell upon the cold face of Tirant, so that it
seemed that he too was weeping, although dead. That
pallid face again and again she kissed, and all the while
she was lamenting, uttering words of love, of grief, and
of despair. All those who witnessed the anguish and
suffering of the princess wept with her. Finally she was
taken back to the palace. She asked her attendants to
weep with her, for she would not be with them much
longer. Her grief was so poignant that blood flowed
from her mouth. The physicians saw in her condition
the signs of one doomed to die. The aged emperor,
who could not bear to witness the sufferings of his daughter,
had retired to his chamber. And now she sent for him,
for her soul wished to go where the soul of her hero was.
She made a public confession and received Holy Communion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
after which she sent for the emperor’s secretary,
who drew up her last will and testament. Then she
kissed the emperor and the empress many times and bade
them farewell. The venerable monarch was overcome
with grief and anguish, and fell to the floor unconscious.
He was carried into another room and laid on a bed,
and there he died. Then, as successor to the imperial
throne, she ordered that the corpse of Tirant be brought
to her. She had it placed at her left side, and the corpse
of the emperor was placed on the right side. She kissed
her father often, but Tirant she kissed even more frequently.
Then she invited Death to come and take her
so that she might be with her lover. Finally she asked
for the cross. When it was presented to her, she fixed
her eyes upon it, and after saying a long prayer with
intense devotion, she rendered her soul to God. And
when she died there was seen a great splendor of angels,
who bore away her soul with that of Tirant, for the soul
of her beloved had waited for hers. (Chaps. 472-478)</p>

<p>The obsequies of the emperor were celebrated with
great splendor. Many kings, dukes, earls, marquises,
noble knights, and the people of the city were present.
The clergy sang the divine offices with such sorrow,
that there was not one person present who did not weep.
The following day the funeral rites were performed with
an equal splendor and solemnity in honor of the princess,
and on the third day, Tirant, the late Caesar of the Greek
empire, was honored by ceremonies no less magnificent
than the preceding. The body of the emperor was laid
in a beautiful tomb, but the bodies of Tirant and the
princess were enclosed in a casket, and with an escort
of forty galleys they were taken to Brittany and placed
in a magnificent tomb in the principal church of the city
of Nantes. (Chaps. 471, 485)</p>

<p>The empress married Hypolite, and thus he who had
fought so well and bravely as Capita Major while Tirant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
was conquering Barbary became emperor. He was much
loved and feared by his subjects and by those outside
of his realm. He conquered many provinces, amassed
great treasures, and his rule was long and prosperous.

<p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12">[12]</a> To the honor, praise and glory of our Lord God, Jesus Christ,
and of the glorious most blessed Virgin Mary, His Mother, Our
Lady. Here beginneth the dedicatory letter of this book entitled
<em>Tirant lo Blanch</em>, addressed by Sir Johanot Martorell, Knight, to
the most serene Prince Ferdinand of Portugal.</p></div>

<p>In this letter we are told that Prince Ferdinand found
great delight in the contemplation of heroic deeds. His
most enthusiastic admiration was called forth by the
feats of that famous hero, Tirant lo Blanch, who outshone
all other knights as the sun outshines all other planets.
But, according to this letter, the story of that great
knight was written in the English language. Prince
Ferdinand wished to have it translated into Portuguese,
and since he knew that Martorell had spent some time in
England, he considered him well qualified to do the work.
Accordingly he asked him to translate the book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Martorell, however, expresses a feeling of incompetency,
and on account of his professional and family
affairs and the adversities of fortune which do not permit
him to enjoy peace of mind, he feels that he might be
justified in declining the noble task. But notwithstanding
all these obstacles he will undertake it, for surely the
Sovereign Good, who comes to the aid of those who wish
to do worthy things, will not fail him in his endeavor.
Then in an enterprising spirit he announces:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He asks the prince to accept the book as from a devoted
servant, and begs him to overlook with indulgence
the errors that may be found therein, for in some passages
it was impossible to give a good translation of the
English words. The letter closes as follows:</p>

<p>According to the above representations, <em>Tirant lo
Blanch</em> existed originally as an English romance of chivalry
which was translated into Portuguese by Martorell;
then the Portuguese version was translated into the
Valencian language, three parts of it by Martorell and
the fourth part by de Galba.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>But the literary world knows no English <em>Tirant lo
Blanch</em>, nor, so far as can be discovered, has it ever seen
a reference to a romance of that description except the
statements in the Catalan book. Consequently no little
doubt arises as to an English original. The same is the
case concerning a Portuguese <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em>, and the
doubt as to the accuracy of Martorell’s and de Galba’s
assertions increases considerably. And then, finally, the
contents of the work, its spirit, its sources, and the fact
that there is a <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em> in the Catalan language,
strongly impel the reader to conclude that the Catalan
book is the original.</p>

<p>Let us first consider the question as to an English
original. After a careful study of <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em>, we
have come to the conclusion that it is hardly possible
that it ever existed as an English romance. That conclusion
is based on a study of its principal sources and on
the nature of its contents. A truly Catalan atmosphere
pervades by far the greater part of it. The court and
military life of the Catalonians and Aragonese, their political
problems and aspirations, their hopes and fears,—all
these are vividly reflected in this romance of chivalry.
Their history and their literature are so closely interwoven
with the story of Tirant lo Blanch, that we can
scarcely conceive it possible that it is not a Catalan production.
We believe that when Martorell says that the
work is translated from the English, he means that it
has been inspired by an English book. And his statement
has the semblance of truth, for his composition
contains a reproduction of a considerable part of the
English romance, <em>Guy of Warwick</em>, somewhat modified
however, together with an account of the institution of
the Order of the Garter, of which the scenes of action
are all laid in England. To the story based on the above
romance has been joined material derived from other
sources, and one of these is Raymond Lull’s <em>Libre del Orde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
d’Cauayleria</em>. In the story, of which the material from
these two sources forms the foundation, Guy of Warwick
is represented as Guillem de Varoych, and for this reason
we shall name this composite reproduction, the William
of Warwick episode.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em> begins with this
episode, which occupies a little more than one-eighth
part of the complete work. But this is not the only part
in which the influence of <em>Guy of Warwick</em> is revealed.
We know that Martorell, when he planned his book of
chivalry, was acquainted with the story of Guy of Warwick,
and in the course of the composition certain
features of the latter occurred to him and were incorporated
in his work. But these are not very numerous,
and they are so sparsely scattered that the pronounced
Catalan atmosphere in which they appear absorbs whatever
distinguishing characteristics they may have had
originally. Our investigations, the details of which will
follow, lead us to the conclusion that if <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em>
had an English original, this must have been written by a
Catalan,—which, to say the least, is improbable. Scholars
who have given some attention to this question entertain
serious doubts concerning the representations that
the work is translated from the English. Menéndez y
Pelayo regards the question as very problematic.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Givanel
Mas, in his excellent study on <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em>,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> intimates
that it is doubtful that there has existed an English
original. Still he would consider it bold to deny that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>book has ever appeared in English or in Portuguese.
But, on the other hand, he sees no reason why we should
consider it impossible that the author has followed the
custom of writers of chivalry, who, in perhaps a majority
of cases, pretend that their works were based on productions
found in foreign languages, not only in Greek,
Latin, and Arabic, but also in English and German.
Bonsoms y Sicart says: “No cabe duda que la celebrada
novela es hija de la imaginación del magnífico y virtuoso
caballero valenciano.”<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Rubió y Lluch makes this
statement: “El Tirant, en la parte fundamental, en el
carácter general del cuadro en que los personajes se mueven
con más desembarazo, es indígena, es catalán por
sus cuatro costados.”<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17">[17]</a> Why did Martorell change the name from Guy to William
(Guillem)? The Catalan form for Guy is Guiu, which may have
been easily confused in the MSS. with Guim, a contracted form of
Guillem. If this substitution did not result from a confusion in
names, the resemblance may have suggested Guillem, which was
more popular and therefore may have seemed preferable.</p></div>

<p>There is a passage in the William of Warwick episode
which we feel is a probable indication that the author
was not English. When the hermit-king, as leader of
the English forces, recaptured the castle of Alimburch
from the Moors, in which the latter held many Christian
ladies as captives, Johan de Varoych, son of Guillem,
called to them in the following words: “Dones angleses,
exiu defora e tornau en vostra primera libertat, car
vengut es lo dia de la vostra redempcio.”<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Why did the
author say “Dones angleses”? Is it not probable that
he for the moment had forgotten that the work was supposed
to be a translation from the English, and addressed
the ladies as a foreigner might have done?</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_22_22" id="Footnote_22_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_22">[22]</a> English ladies, come out and enjoy your former liberty, for
the day of your redemption has come.</p></div>

<p>In spite of our efforts to take the author at his word,
we feel moved to conclude that the work was not translated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>from an English original. We believe that a statement
to that effect was made, because the beginning of
<em>Tirant lo Blanch</em> was a kind of reproduction of a romance
in which an English knight was the hero, and because
the events that are recounted in that first part took
place in England. The declaration was perhaps suggested
by examples of other authors of romances of
chivalry who attributed their works to foreign sources.</p>

<p>But if there was no English original, was there some
other work to be translated? In what language was it
written? For lack of any other information, we shall
have to conclude that it was in Catalan, for the contents
of the final version clearly indicate that. This, then,
was translated into Portuguese, and then into Catalan.
How absurd! for it already existed in Catalan. It is
evident that there was no translating to be done.</p>

<p>If the book was not translated from an English, or
a Catalan original, it may be asked whether it was first
written in Portuguese and then translated into Catalan.
In attempting to answer this question it is necessary
to remember the reason that is given for translating
the work from English into Portuguese, viz., that Prince
Ferdinand of Portugal asked Martorell to produce the
work in the Portuguese language. And who was this
“serenissimo princep”?</p>

<p>Prince Ferdinand (1433-1470) was the second son of
King Edward I of Portugal. His mother was Doña
Leonor de Aragón, a daughter of King Ferdinand I.
At the death of King Edward, in 1438, the latter’s eldest
son mounted the throne as Alfonso V. He was but six
years old, and in order that there might be no question
as to the succession, “foi o Infante D. Fernando jurado
Principe pellos Infantes, e pello Conde de Barcellos e por
todos os que eraõ presentes, por si, e por todos os do
Reyno, de que se fizeraõ Autos solemnizados por Notarios
publicos e dahi em diante se chamou Principe de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Portugal.”<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> This prince was, according to de la Clède,
“Duc de Viseo, Grand Maître de Christ et de Saint
Jacques en Portugal, et Connétable du Roiaume.”<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> He
took an active part in the fighting against the Moors
in the northwestern part of Africa.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_23_23" id="Footnote_23_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_23">[23]</a> The Infante, D. Ferdinand was solemnly accepted as Prince
by the other Infantes, and by the Count of Barcellos and by all
those who were present, for themselves and for those of the kingdom;
duly attested acts of this action were drawn up by notaries,
and henceforth he was called Prince of Portugal. Duarte Nunes
de Leaõ, <em>Cronicas del rey Dom Joaõ de gloriosa memoria, o I.
deste nome, e dos reys de Portugal o X., e as dos reys D. Duarte,
e D. Affonso o V.</em>, Lisbon, 1780; vol. 2, p. 86.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_24_24" id="Footnote_24_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_24">[24]</a> M. de la Clède, <em>Histoire générale de Portugal</em>, Paris, 1735;
vol. 3, p. 242.</p></div>

<p>Apparently, then, this dedication and all that concerns
Prince Ferdinand is written in good faith. And since he
was a Portuguese, it would be only natural to suppose
that the book was composed in the Portuguese language.</p>

<p>But this supposition loses much of its force when we
consider that his mother was a Catalan, and consequently
it is probable that he knew, or, at least, understood the
Catalan language. Then, too, Martorell, who was so
fond of making elaborate descriptions of court life, fails
to reveal this tendency in telling about Tirant’s visit to
the Portuguese court at Lisbon, while this hero was on
his way from Brittany to Sicily. A few cold, matter-of-fact
statements of that brief stay are the only homage
he renders to the kingdom of his patron. Surely that was
an excellent opportunity to sing the praises of Portugal,
its heroes, and its rulers, but to our great surprise no
such attempt is made. This fact is indeed astonishing,
and causes us to doubt that the book was written under
the direction or at the request of a Portuguese. Moreover,
at the very time that Martorell was engaged in
the composition of <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em>, the Portuguese were
doing what they had been doing for years, performing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>heroic exploits in their wars against the Moors on the
African shores opposite the Spanish peninsula. In the
book under consideration the hero conquers that very
territory, but the Portuguese efforts find no place in
the account of that victorious campaign. And yet
that conquest had a historical basis, for it was founded
on conditions and events described in Muntaner’s
<em>Chronica</em>.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> We cannot help asking ourselves the question:
Why did Martorell wholly disregard the great
deeds of valor of the Portuguese heroes? He has given
proof of being well versed in the history of his times,
and surely he had heard and read of their prowess. The
answer that suggests itself is, that the experiences of
his native land with Barbary as narrated in the <em>Chronica</em>
were uppermost in his mind, and while he was writing
the book the exploits of the Portuguese probably did
not occur to him. If such was the case, it is highly probable
that he did not reside at the Portuguese court, and
perhaps Prince Ferdinand was not much more than a
name to him. In the kind of work undertaken by the
author, a work based principally on historical events
and the customs of the times, intermingled with literary
productions and problems that confronted Christianity
and involved the destiny of nations, the absence of traces
of Portuguese influence from the fields of history and of
literature, or from any other field, causes us to doubt
seriously that the book was originally in Portuguese.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, Martorell, who was to write this book, was
a Catalan. Was he as excellent a master of Portuguese
as he was of his native tongue? We have no definite
information in that regard upon which we may rely.
Surely he was courageous to write such a voluminous
work in Portuguese, if he did not control that language
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>with ease. When he drew his material from
Lull’s and from Metge’s works (see pp. 79-89), did he
translate it into Portuguese and then turn it back into
Catalan without consulting the corresponding passages in
the sources? If such was the case, there would have been
a greater difference in the parallel passages. But a man
who is a master of the two languages would never take
that trouble. And why should he try to make the passages
exactly alike? Now, what was Martorell to write
about? About a great hero whose name was Tirant lo
Blanch and whose deeds were so much admired by
Prince Ferdinand. But this Tirant lo Blanch is not
a historical personage, he is an imaginary individual, a
literary character. If the Catalan Tirant had not yet
been written, if there was not even such a literary character,
how, then, could the Prince have become so
enthusiastic about him?</p>

<p>The strongest argument in favor of a Portuguese
original is the fact that de Galba states that he translated
the final fourth part from the Portuguese. But we must
remember that Martorell says that he will translate the
Portuguese into Catalan, and for that reason de Galba
was obliged to say the same. But the same style, vocabulary,
method of composing the work, the point of view
and characteristics of the author are in evidence throughout
the book. For this reason it may seem that Martorell
wrote the whole work in Portuguese and then translated
three-fourths of it into Catalan. He died and de Galba
completed it. But if the latter had translated the fourth
part, we feel that we should have been able to discover
some differences in style, spelling and vocabulary, and an
absence of some of the favorite expressions of Martorell.
If he had composed that part we should not have had
much difficulty in detecting it. Consequently we cannot
believe that <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em> was first written in Portuguese,
and then translated into Catalan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>However, we accept in full faith the statement of the
author that he is a Valencian. The contents of his
work corroborate it. He knew that Ferdinand was Prince
of Portugal; but did the latter ask him to translate the
English original? We cannot believe that there was
such a book in English, and consequently we doubt that
<em>Tirant</em> was written at this request. We shall probably
never be able to discover whether Martorell was personally
acquainted with Prince Ferdinand, or whether he
ever was in communication with him. The details of the
dedicatory letter point in that direction, but perhaps
that was only an ingenious way of the author to induce
us to give credit to his statements. However that may
be, there was probably some good reason for dedicating
the work to the prince, but very likely we shall never
know just what that reason was.</p>

<p>If we cannot believe that there was an English original,
and we doubt that the book was first written in Portuguese,
then it is probable that we shall conclude that
<em>Tirant lo Blanch</em> was first written in Catalan. Perhaps
an attempt to prove that it is a Catalan production will
help us solve the problem.</p>

<p>In the composition of this book, material drawn from
Catalan history and Catalan literature has been utilized.
The former we shall discuss in other parts of this work,
but we take up at this time two of the literary sources.
First let us give a series of parallel passages from Raymond
Lull’s <em>Libre del Orde d’Cauayleria</em> and from <em>Tirant
lo Blanch</em> in order to see what can be gained from a
study of these.</p>

<p>The five parallel passages given above indicate that
Martorell had Lull’s work before his eyes at the time that
he was writing the part that treats of the meeting of
young Tirant and the hermit and their conversation
concerning the order of Chivalry. The first passage from
the <em>Libre del Orde d’Cauayleria</em> is an excellent example
of the author’s method in selecting a foundation on
which to base the various and numerous activities of
his hero. The passage is important, for it has furnished
an interesting manner of introducing Tirant lo Blanch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
to the reader, and, moreover, it may have been the
author’s starting point. The corresponding passage
from Martorell’s work reveals that the source was followed
very closely. It is an easy matter to pick out the
part of it that he needed to change in order to make
it suit his purpose. The details of the latter part give
evidence that he consulted the source probably more
than once, and that the modifications which we find there
are not necessarily due to the processes of translation.
The same may be said of the second parallel passages.
But the other three are so very nearly alike that the
translation theory must be given up. Let us remember
what we are asked to believe. We are told that <em>Tirant
lo Blanch</em> was translated from the English. Then these
passages were translated from Lull’s work (written in
Catalan), first into English, then into Portuguese, and
finally back into Catalan. And in all these various
processes the passages in their final form are practically
the same as the original. Is not this a marvelous
achievement? We cannot believe the author’s ingenious
representations. We are convinced that <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em>
was not translated from the English. And since that is
the case, is it not probable that it was not written in Portuguese?
We admit that by translating from the Catalan
into Portuguese, and then back again into Catalan, the
resulting passages might not be so very different. But
we cannot believe that they could be so similar to the
original after two translations. Then, how do we account
for the changes? A comparative study of Lull’s style
and language and that of Martorell shows that there
was considerable difference between them. Of course,
it was not the latter’s intention to copy the material
word for word. He recast it, adapting it to his style
and vocabulary; in other words, he took in general
merely the ideas and expressed them in his own way. If
Lull’s manner of expression in certain cases agreed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
his own, he did not make any changes. He added or
omitted incidents at his own pleasure. Sometimes he
made a reproduction, and at other times a copy with
only such alterations as were necessary to make the passages
conform to his own style, which presumably he
considered an improvement over the original. Some few
changes may have been caused by misreading or in the
process of copying. Now and then we get the impression
that he made certain alterations in order to avoid a literal
transcription. A glance over the above passages shows
that Martorell changed certain words. For “palaffre”
he substituted “roci”; for “vestiments,” “vestidures”;
for “magre,” “flach”; for “ausi” (heard), “hoy”; for
“remembrar,” “recordar” or “esser en recort de”; for
“consirer,” “entrar en gran pensament”; for “honrament,”
“honor”; for “tro,” “fins”; for “en axi,” “axi”;
for “pus” in comparisons, “mes.” A study of Martorell’s
vocabulary reveals that the words for which he
made substitutions are lacking in it. Other similar
cases may be found, but, to prove our point, we do not
feel it necessary to make an exhaustive study of the
vocabularies of these authors. We shall, however, call
attention to the ending of the first parallel passages.
Lull says: “... e per les lagremes que gitaua, sos hulls
foren apoquits.” The corresponding passage of Martorell
reads: “e per les moltes lagremes quels seus hulls
destillauen li eren los hulls molt apoquits.” There is
much weeping in <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em>, and the author’s
favorite way of describing it is something like this: “los
seus hulls destillaren vives lagremes.” Without making
an exhaustive search for this expression, we find twenty-one
instances in <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em> where the words “hulls,”
some form of “destillar,” and “lagremes” are used to
describe this emotional manifestation. He expresses it
in other ways, but he never uses the verb “gitar,”
which is employed by Lull in this connection. Martorell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
never uses this word, but, on the other hand, he frequently
employs “lançar” with the very same meaning.</p>

<p>After a careful comparison of the above passages,
we are satisfied that the book under consideration is not
a translation from an English original, nor was it first
written in Portuguese. However, if the reader is still
doubtful in regard to these questions, let us examine
other parallel passages, of which the originals are found
in another Catalan production, which bears the title Lo
<em>Somni d’En Bernat Metge</em>.</p>

<p>All that we have said in support of our contention that
the excerpts from <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em> in the first series of
parallel passages have been taken directly from Lull’s
work, and not from a translation, is borne out by a
comparison of the passages just given. We feel that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the evidence is conclusive and that comment would be
superfluous. And with all this array of evidence we feel
justified in concluding that <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em> was written
originally in Catalan. Martorell was a learned Catalan;
he was well versed in the history of his country and its
literature; he was a master of his native language; and
he composed his voluminous work in the tongue that
he knew so well. If <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em> was translated into
Portuguese, it was not from an English but from a Catalan
original that the translation was made.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II
<br />
<small>IN WHAT WAY WAS DE GALBA CONNECTED WITH THE
PRODUCTION OF TIRANT LO BLANCH?</small></h3>


<p>We are told in the note at the end of the book that
Martorell, because of his death, was unable to translate
more than three parts of it, and that “la quarta part
que es la fi del libre es stada traduida ... per lo magnifich
caualler Mossen Marti Johan de Galba.” Now the
question arises: What did de Galba have to do with the
production of <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em>? It is difficult to answer
the question definitely.</p>

<p>In the first place, we do not know what the four parts
of the book are. Martorell, at the beginning of the work,
probably intended to divide it into a number of parts,
for, after the dedication and the prologue, we read:
“Comença la primera part del libre de Tirant la qual
tracta de certs virtuosos actes que feu lo Comte Guillem
de Ueroych en los seus benaventurats darrers dies.”
Then, in the chapter immediately following this caption,
we find these words: “E per tant com la divina providencia
ha ordenat, e li plau que los .vii. planets donen
influencia en lo mon e tenen domini sobre la humana
natura.... per ço ab lo diuinal adiutori sera departit
lo present libre de caualleria en .vii. parts principals....
La primera part sera del principi de caualleria.
La segona sera del stament e offici de caualleria, etc.”
After informing us of what these seven parts shall treat,
he makes this puzzling statement: “Les quals .vii.
parts de caualleria seran deduydes en serta part del<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
libre.”<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Here, then, we have the conflicting statements
that the book is to be divided into seven parts, and
then follows the announcement that these seven parts
shall be produced in a certain part of the work. But
nowhere in it do we find any indications that the author
attempted to make such a division. It is true, as we have
already stated, that the beginning of the first part is
announced, but after that no mention of the beginning
or end of any other part is made. A logical division
into four almost equal parts is absolutely impossible.
But we do find that in Chapters <span class="smcap lowercase">XXXI</span>-<span class="smcap lowercase">XXXVI</span> some of
the subjects mentioned in the proposed divisions of the
work are treated and discussed.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_29_29" id="Footnote_29_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_29">[29]</a> Here commences the first part of the book of Tirant, which
treats of certain great deeds done by the Earl, William of Warwick,
in his last blessed days.... And inasmuch as Divine Providence
has ordained and is pleased that the seven planets exert an influence
over the world and hold dominion over human nature. ... on
account of this, with divine aid, this book of chivalry will be divided
into seven principal parts.... The first part shall treat of the
beginning of chivalry. The second shall treat of the state and profession
of chivalry, etc.... These seven parts shall be presented
in a certain part of the book.</p></div>

<p>An examination of Lull’s <em>Libre del Orde d’Cauayleria</em>
will explain the inconsistency. In this book we find,
in the “Incipit Prologus,” the following words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Per Significança de les .vii. planetes ... que
gouernen e ordonen los corsos terrenals, departim
aquest libre d’cauayleria en .vii. parts.... La
primera part es d’l començament d’cauayleria.
La segona es del offici de cauayleria, etc.”<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_30_30" id="Footnote_30_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_30">[30]</a> With the significance of the seven planets ... which govern
and control the terrestrial bodies, we divide this book of chivalry
into seven parts.... The first part treats of the commencement
of chivalry. The second treats of the profession of chivalry, etc.</p></div>

<p>Martorell had evidently copied from Lull’s book, and
the inconsistency was overlooked and found its way into
his work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>We have made endeavors to locate the fourth part,
which we are told was translated by de Galba, but all
our efforts have been in vain. We have carefully examined
the spelling, vocabulary, and style of the whole book,
but have been unable to find any part that differed
sufficiently from the rest of the work to justify the assertion
of even a possibility that it represents the part
translated by de Galba. The statement can hardly
be accepted, for we cannot find anything at all that
would tend to support or corroborate it in any way.</p>

<p>But we have concluded that <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em> was
originally written in Catalan. Consequently it is not
the question: What part did de Galba translate? but,
What part did he write? It is not a difficult matter to
see why de Galba states that he <em>translated</em> the fourth
part. Martorell had called his book a translation and
consequently de Galba was obliged to do the same.
But the assumption that the latter wrote a part of considerable
importance can hardly be maintained. We have
already remarked that there is no appreciable difference
in vocabulary and style in any part. Moreover, we
find throughout the work a marked similarity in the
manner of observation and description. The author has
certain favorite expressions which he uses again and
again, and these are not confined to any special parts.
The same method of composing the book is followed
from beginning to end. The same mind and the same
heart are always in evidence. The different characters,
when laboring under intense emotion, speak and act in
practically the same way. Martorell has stamped his
work with a strong individuality, and his characteristics
are revealed throughout. All these facts tend to indicate
that <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em> is the work of one author and one
only. If it were not for the statement to the contrary,
we feel certain that no one would ever doubt that the
whole book was written by Martorell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>But if we conclude that de Galba neither translated
nor wrote a considerable part of the work, what did he do
that would give him any right to claim part of the honor
in the production? Perhaps Givanel Mas is right when
he hints that de Galba’s rôle was limited to the preparation
of the manuscript for publication. We are rather
inclined to accept that suggestion. We are, however,
disposed to add that probably de Galba did contribute
something to the story. Perhaps he wrote the very last
chapter, which consists of about three hundred words.
We suggest this probability, because the reading of that
chapter leaves the impression that the ending of the
story is overdone. It may be that he wrote it for no
other reason than to be able to say that he “translated”
the fourth part, “la fi del libre.” In this chapter we are
told that under the rule of Hypolite the empire was
prosperous and extended its limits. After the death of
the empress, according to the same chapter, he married
a daughter of the King of England, who bore him three
sons and two daughters. The eldest of these sons was
named after his father and performed great deeds of
prowess. The emperor and the empress reached a very
advanced age, and they died on the same day. Their
rule was so excellent, and their lives were so good and
virtuous, that we may feel assured that they are now
enjoying the glory of heaven.</p>

<p>We have not been able to find anything in the style
and language of this last chapter that would indicate
that it was written by any other than Martorell, and
we confess that our suggestion is based almost exclusively
upon the fact that it might very well have been omitted.
In the chapters immediately preceding this one, Tirant
and Carmesina are placed in their tomb, Hypolite marries
the empress, rewards his friends, and marries them to
ladies of the imperial court. The closing words of the
next to the last chapter are:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Apres dona a tots aquells qui se eren casats
ab les criades de la Emperadriu e de la Princessa
bones heretats, quen podien molt be viure a
lur honor, e cascu segons son grau, que tots
nestauen molt contents. E apres per temps
casa totes les altres axi com de bon senyor se
pertanyia.”<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_31_31" id="Footnote_31_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_31">[31]</a> Afterwards, to all those who had married the maids of the
empress and of the princess, he gave generous gifts, so that they
could live well and in honor, and each one according to his rank.
As a result all were very happy. And in time, as a worthy lord
ought, he gave all the others maids in marriage.</p></div>

<p>The passage just quoted seems to have been intended
for the conclusion of <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em>. This indication,
together with the fact that the last chapter seems unnecessary
and superfluous, surely justifies the suggestion that
probably de Galba wrote “la fi del libre,” but not the
fourth part, unless he called these last few lines “la
quarta part.”</p>

<p>The best explanation that we can suggest in regard to
de Galba’s statement is, that on account of preparing
the manuscript for the printer, he considered himself
entitled to some credit in the production of this book.
Why he claims to have translated the fourth part can
only be a matter of conjecture. Perhaps that part was
in special need of revision. He may have made some
changes or additions, but we cannot admit that he wrote
or translated the whole or a considerable portion of it.</p>

<h2>PART III
<br />
<small>COMPARATIVE STUDY OF <em>TIRANT LO BLANCH</em> AND

<h3>CHAPTER I
<br />
<small>WILLIAM OF WARWICK STANDS FOR THE MATURE
GUY OF WARWICK</small></h3>


<p>Towards the end of his book, the author of <em>Tirant
lo Blanch</em> annexed to the life of his hero, with extensive
modifications however, the latter part of the career of
the famous Catalan hero, Roger de Flor, whose life from
childhood to death is related in Muntaner’s <em>Chronica</em>.
It is not so strange, then, that those who have read
<em>Tirant lo Blanch</em> and are acquainted with the life of
Roger de Flor should designate Martorell’s work as a
kind of historical novel.</p>

<p>In his excellent <em>Estudio crítico de Tirant lo Blanch</em>,
Givanel Mas exclaims:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In Denk’s <em>Geschichte der altcatalanischen Litteratur</em> we

<p>In Menéndez y Pelayo’s <em>Orígenes de la Novela</em> we find
the following passage:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>El tema principal de la novela, las empresas
de Tirante en Grecia y Asia ... dan al Tirante
cierto sello de novela histórica, donde se reconoce

1905; tomo I, p. ccliv.</p></div>

<p>But when we compare this book of chivalry with
Muntaner’s <em>Chronica</em> and with <em>Guy of Warwick</em>, we see
that these quotations, while true in general, are at the
same time more or less misleading, for the English romance
has provided more material than is generally believed,
not only that which furnished the basis of the William
of Warwick episode, but also elements that were utilized
in different parts of the work. Therefore we shall point
out all the constituents or features that seem to owe
their origin to the English romance, <em>Guy of Warwick</em>,
or to that part of Muntaner’s <em>Chronica</em> which contains
the life of Roger de Flor.</p>

<p>In the William of Warwick episode, with which we
have begun our analysis, Martorell has given us a kind of
free reproduction of an important part of <em>Guy of Warwick</em>.
But the Catalan author is not a servile imitator;
the incidents that he has taken from the English romance
he has treated in such a way as to render them more
interesting than the original.</p>

<p>The episode is based upon the following events which
we find in the fourteenth-century versions of the Guy of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>Warwick romance<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>: After many knightly combats and
adventures on the continent, and after slaying the dragon
in Northumberland, Guy married Felice, the daughter
of Earl Rohold. The newly married couple lived in
great happiness for two weeks. One evening, after a
hunt, Guy mounted a high tower, where he admired
the stars of heaven. He thought of the many honors
that had been bestowed upon him by Christ, our Saviour,
and then it occurred to him that he had never done anything
for the Lord in return. On the contrary, he had
engaged in wars, wrought much woe, and slain many
of his fellow-men. He became deeply repentant and
resolved to spend the rest of his life as a pilgrim, and
thus make amends for his transgressions. He informed
Felice of his resolution. She, in tears, begged him to
remain with her, but he was firm. Before his departure,
she gave him a ring as a remembrance of her. He crossed
the sea and proceeded on his way to Jerusalem.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_35_35" id="Footnote_35_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35_35">[35]</a> These fourteenth-century versions were edited from the Auchinleck
MS. in the Advocates’ Library, Edinburgh, and from MS.
107 in Caius College, Cambridge, by Julius Zupitza, and published
for the Early English Text Society, London, 1883, 1887, and 1891.
For the beginning of the episode, cf. p. 396.</p></div>

<p>After many adventures abroad Guy finally returned to
England. During his absence the Danes had invaded
the country and wrought great destruction. When he
arrived at Winchester none that saw him recognized him.
Just at the time of his arrival, the English king, Aethelstan,
was holding a council with the leading men of the
realm. They were considering the demand of the Danish
king that the English surrender the kingdom and pay
tribute to Denmark or bring some one forth to engage in
combat with the giant, Colbrond, the champion of the
Danes. If this giant should be vanquished, the invaders
would leave the soil of England; but if, on the other hand,
he should be victorious, the English would be obliged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>to pay tribute to the Danes. King Aethelstan asked
his assembled men if they knew any knight who would
dare to fight against Colbrond, but they all stood silent
with downcast eyes. The king could not sleep that
night, and was praying incessantly that God might send
some one to champion the cause of England, when an
angel appeared before him and bade him arise early the
following morning and go to church, where he would
find a pilgrim who would undertake the fight against the
giant. Early the next morning the king met the pilgrim.
The latter at first declined the king’s behest, pleading
feebleness and old age, but finally consented. On the
day appointed the pilgrim went to the spot where the
combat was to take place, knelt down and prayed for
victory. Then came Colbrond on foot, for he was too
heavy for any horse. All his armor was black, and his
appearance such as to make one shudder. Guy rode
towards him and the combat began. The giant cut
Guy’s steed in two without much delay. Guy was then
obliged to fight on foot, and he was scarcely able to reach
his adversary’s shoulder with his sword. Nevertheless
he succeeded in inflicting an ugly wound on Colbrond,
who returned the blow, cutting Guy’s shield in twain.
A moment later Guy struck a vigorous blow with his
sword and broke it. Thereupon he seized one of the
axes of the giant, who immediately drove his sword
at him with all his might, but missed him, the sword
going three feet into the earth. While he was stooping
to pull it out, Guy cut off his right arm. The giant
made a desperate effort to extricate his weapon with his
left, but before he could do so, Guy severed his head from
the body. Thus was Colbrond, champion of the Danes,
vanquished, and the invaders, true to their word, boarded
their ships and returned to their country.</p>

<p>Guy was led back into the town of Winchester in a
great triumphal procession. King Aethelstan wished to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
reward him, but the pilgrim would accept nothing. The
king asked him to reveal his name. The stranger replied
that if he would accompany him out of the city,
his wish should be granted. Aethelstan went with him
and was amazed when he found out that the pilgrim
was none other than Guy of Warwick. He asked him
to remain with him, but the request was denied. Both
weeping, they kissed each other and parted. Guy, in
his pilgrim garb, went to the city of Warwick, where he
presented himself before his wife, Felice, who gave him
food without recognizing him. She asked him to come
every day, and he should always receive food and drink
from her; but he never returned. Going instead to visit
a certain hermit, he found that the latter had died during
his absence. Guy then decided to pass the remainder of
his days in the deserted hermitage. One night an angel
appeared to him and announced that on the morning
of the eighteenth day he should exchange this world for
heaven. When the period had almost expired he sent a
messenger to Felice with the ring that she had given
him when he set out on his pilgrimage. Recognizing
the ring, she fell unconscious. After recovering, she
immediately went to him. Guy kissed her tenderly and
then passed away. A few days later Felice was buried
at his side.</p>

<p>This part of the English romance was utilized by
Martorell to form the foundation of the William of
Warwick episode. He made changes and additions to
suit his purpose, following the general plan, but inventing
the details. The simple ring he describes as a complicated
double ring; the Danish invasion as an incursion
of the Moors; and the angel that appeared to the king
as the Virgin and the Child. When the Danish champion
is defeated, the Danes withdraw from England; but
when the Moorish king is vanquished, the Moors do not
leave the kingdom as they had agreed to do. Consequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
a campaign to exterminate the Moors results,
and William of Warwick becomes the commander of the
English forces.</p>

<p>But all of the episode is not based on <em>Guy of Warwick</em>.
We have seen in the beginning of the analysis that, after
the Moors had been annihilated, William again returned
to a hermitage. Up to this point Martorell followed
his model rather faithfully, but thereafter he abandoned
it. However, he continued the episode, drawing
his material from a different source. In order to point
out to the reader what parts of the episode are not
based on the English romance, and at the same time to
give a concrete example of the method followed by Martorell
in the composition of his work, we shall note the
procedure of the author in the continuation of this episode.</p>

<p>In the prologue of Lull’s <em>Libre del Orde d’Cauayleria</em>
Martorell had read of a great knight who likewise had
retired to a hermitage, and doubtless this striking coincidence,
which apparently had attracted his attention
even before he began writing his romance, caused him
to incorporate in the episode the incident related by
Lull. The prologue recites how, in a certain country,
a knight, who for a long time had been an honor to
knighthood, finally realized that the end of his days
was approaching, whereupon he decided to spend the rest
of his life as a hermit. Accordingly he went to live
in a dense forest. It was his custom to come every
day to a clear spring under a large tree, where he was
wont to contemplate and pray. Now it happened that
a great king had announced an assembly of his court,
and a certain mounted squire was proceeding on his way
to attend that court in order that knighthood might be
conferred upon him. Overcome by the fatigue of the
journey, the squire fell asleep. His steed left the road,
entered the wood, and came to a spring at a time
when the hermit was there. The latter discontinued his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
prayers when he saw the squire approaching and began
to read in a book. When the steed stopped at the spring
to drink, the rider awoke and was surprised to see the
aged hermit before him. After exchanging greetings,
the hermit spoke to the youth of things pertaining to
knighthood, and when they parted, asked him to come
back after he had been made a knight.</p>

<p>The author of <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em> incorporated in his
work the incident just mentioned by paraphrasing it
and by reproducing certain parts almost literally, as we
have already observed, making such changes as he saw
fit. In the reproduction of this incident the unknown
hermit is William of Warwick; the unnamed king is the
King of England; and the squire is Tirant lo Blanch.
In Lull’s work the hermit invites the squire to return,
but he never comes back. Martorell makes his hero
accept the hermit’s invitation, and Tirant with his companions
returns to William of Warwick, when the principal
events that took place at the English court, including
the marvelous feats of Tirant, are related to him. The
deeds that Martorell ascribes to Tirant while at the court
of the English king are not similar to those of Guy of
Warwick as described in the English romance. They
are probably inventions of the author, based on what he
witnessed, heard, or read in connection with tournaments
or knightly affairs. Tirant remained with the hermit
for a few days and then returned to his native land,
Brittany. Here ends the William of Warwick episode.</p>

<p>To sum up: All that part of the episode up to and
including the retirement of William of Warwick to a
hermitage after the extermination of the Moors, is based
on the English romance, but only on that portion of it
that treats of the latter part of the career of the English
hero. The subsequent part of the episode at first seems
to reveal no other traces of the romance, but suddenly
a resemblance emerges.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II
<br />
<small>TIRANT LO BLANCH RESEMBLES YOUNG
GUY OF WARWICK</small></h3>


<p>Perhaps William of Warwick stands for the mature
Guy of Warwick, and Tirant lo Blanch for the youthful
Guy of Warwick. If such is the case, we have met
with a very interesting phenomenon: in the meeting
of the hermit and Tirant we have the venerable and
experienced Guy of Warwick giving instructions in regard
to knighthood to his younger self. Our attention is
first called to this resemblance when we read of the honors
that Tirant gained at London.</p>

<p>Tirant lo Blanch crossed the English Channel, took
part in the exercises of arms that were conducted under
the auspices of the King of England, and won for himself
the honor of being the best knight; for in reading the
document given by the King to Tirant we meet these
words: “... volem que [Tirant lo Blanch] sia per
tots los quatre cantons de les liçes publicat per lo millor
dels cauallers.”<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_36_36" id="Footnote_36_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36_36">[36]</a> It is our desire that [Tirant lo Blanch] be proclaimed from all
four corners of the lists the best of the knights. <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em>,
chap. lviii, col. 2.</p></div>

<p>Guy of Warwick crossed the English Channel, engaged
in a tournament that had been proclaimed by the daughter
of the emperor of Germany, and as a result a sergeant
came to him after the tournament and addressed him
in these words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Sir Guy, he seide, god the kepe:</div>
<div class="i0">Thou art holde the best in this borough</div>
<div class="i0">And in all this londe thurgh and thorough.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_37_37" id="Footnote_37_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_37_37">[37]</a> Caius MS., p. 59.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>But Tirant lo Blanch is supposed to represent Roger
de Flor. Does the youthful career of Tirant resemble
that of the Catalan hero? Let us consult Muntaner’s
<em>Chronica</em>. There we find that Roger de Flor, when
eight years old, began his training for a sea-life and at
the age of twenty was pronounced a perfect mariner and
placed in command of a ship of the Templars. His
early laurels were won as a seaman. No mention is
made of his prowess in the exercise of arms.</p>

<p>From the above comparisons it is evident that Martorell
did not have Roger de Flor in mind when he described
the knightly combats of Tirant. But we do find a strong
similarity between the youthful Tirant and young Guy of
Warwick as he is pictured to us in the English romance.
We know that Martorell had great respect for Guy of
Warwick, for he calls him “lo egregi e strenu caualler,
pare de caualleria.” Perhaps the youthful career of Guy
or other incidents in the English romance have made
such impression on the author as to have left other visible
marks on his book of chivalry? Perhaps <em>Guy of Warwick</em>
has yielded more than is generally believed? Let us
follow the hint and see what result the investigation
will produce.</p>

<p>Guy of Warwick in his youth served Earl Rohold
as cup-bearer, and fell in love with Felice, the daughter
of his lord. Such woe came over him that he wept.
His suffering became greater and greater. Finally he
concluded to tell her of his love, for he could not eat
nor drink nor rest, and his woe was driving him to
despair. He went to her, and throwing himself at her
feet, he made confession of his love. She rebuffed him
and warned him not to come to her again. He returned
to his room, where he tore his hair and rent his clothes
until he swooned. The earl sent doctors, and Guy
pretended to be suffering from chills and fever. Love
again drove him to her feet. A maid remarked that if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
she were the daughter of the richest king on earth, she
could not refuse Guy her love. Felice chided the maid
for her speech, but nevertheless took compassion on the
unhappy lover and promised him her love if he should
become a great knight. And finally Guy, by his valor,
love, and true worth, won her, although he was beneath
her in station.</p>

<p>Tirant, as we have observed in the analysis, was afflicted
in much the same manner, when first he beheld Carmesina.
He, too, was below his lady in station, and his confession
of love was received as an insult. The emperor sent his
physicians to him, and he claimed that his sickness was
due to change of climate. Just as the maid interceded
for Guy, so Stephania pleaded in behalf of Tirant. And
in the end his love, prowess, and great service to the empire
removed the obstacle which the difference in station
had placed between them.</p>

<p>The <em>Chronica</em> of Muntaner does not give us any information
concerning a love affair between Roger de Flor
and the niece of the Emperor of Constantinople. Nor
are there any love scenes at all in that part of the <em>Chronica</em>
that deals with the career of the Catalan hero.</p>

<p>While Guy of Warwick was at Spires with the Emperor
of Germany, they went hunting along the river. When
Guy was returning from the hunt, he noticed a dromond
coming to the shore. He greeted the men in the boat,
and learned that they were merchants who had left
Constantinople because the sultan, after having devastated
nearly all of the Grecian empire, laid siege to the
imperial city. Guy, with his faithful companion from
England, Heraud, and one hundred of the most stalwart
knights that he could find in Germany, went to Constantinople
to succor the unfortunate emperor. When
he arrived His Imperial Majesty greeted him with these
words:</p>

<p>In speaking of the formidable Saracen, Emir Costdram,
a citizen said to Guy:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Guy and his companions, immediately after their arrival,
went out against the enemy, and soon gave proof
of their wonderful fighting qualities. They routed the
Saracens, and in pursuing them Guy overtook Esclandar,
who exclaimed:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i20">Artow Gij?</div>

<p>But Esclandar, after a lance had been driven through
him, was obliged to resume his flight. When the victors
returned to the city, the emperor said to Guy:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Guy had learned through a spy that the sultan was
planning a desperate assault upon Constantinople. He
informed the emperor, who placed the defense of the city
in his hands. Guy, assisted by the Constable, made
preparations to attack the Saracens before they should
reach the city. Before the sortie Guy addressed his
men, urging them to attack boldly and vigorously and
rid the country of the foe. Guy, Heraud, and their
companions performed many prodigies of valor, and the
Greeks, too, fought well. The infidels were slaughtered
by the thousands, and as a result of this victory,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i8">Guy, the good knyght,</div>
<div class="i0">Most was worshipped and that was right.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_42_42" id="Footnote_42_42"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42_42">[42]</a> Caius MS., p. 215.</p></div>

<p>Morgadour, the imperial steward, who aspired to the
hand of the emperor’s daughter, became envious of the
honors won by Guy, and his jealousy and hatred increased
in proportion as the realization of his hopes grew less
and less probable. He plotted to remove his rival
by suggesting to the emperor that Guy and Heraud be
sent as ambassadors to the sultan to make a proposal
of peace. The steward well knew that if they should
go, they would never return. The emperor was willing
to make a proposal of peace to the enemy, but unwilling
that Guy should go on this dangerous mission. However,
Guy insisted upon going. He entered the tent of the
sultan defiantly, and proposed to him that he select
a champion to represent the Saracens. Guy himself
would defend the cause of the emperor. If the sultan’s
champion should win, the Greeks were to pay tribute
to the sultan and acknowledge him as their lord. If,
however, he should be vanquished, the infidels should
leave the country. The sultan’s answer to the proposal
was an order to his men to take and slay the insolent
ambassador. Thereupon the latter drew his sword and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>cut off the sultan’s head, seized it, and hurried away
on his steed. He was pursued and attacked by a multitude
of Saracens, but they were unable to take or to slay
him. When Guy reached the city, he gave the head to
the emperor, and</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Whan thei of the Citee wiste of his comynge</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_43_43" id="Footnote_43_43"></a><a href="#FNanchor_43_43">[43]</a> Caius MS., p. 235.</p></div>

<p>The following day, the emperor said to Guy:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i18">Gij, make the redi;</div>
<div class="i0">Tomorwe thou schalt mi doughter weddi.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_44_44" id="Footnote_44_44"></a><a href="#FNanchor_44_44">[44]</a> <em>Ibid.</em>, p. 240.</p></div>

<p>And so the next day Guy and his companions went to
the church, where they met the imperial family. The
archbishop was there to perform the marriage ceremony.
The emperor addressed Guy with these words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Mi douhter ich giue the here,</div>
<div class="i0">And thritti castels with hir also,</div>

<div class="i0">And half my lond ich giue the,</div>

</div></div></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_45_45" id="Footnote_45_45"></a><a href="#FNanchor_45_45">[45]</a> Auchinleck MS., p. 238.</p></div>

<p>But when the wedding-ring was brought forth a feeling
of distress came over Guy, and this was caused by his
love for Felice. He fell in a swoon, and when he had
recovered consciousness, he asked that the ceremony be
postponed. He was in torment for two weeks. Finally
he resolved to remain true to Felice. Now it happened
that Morgadour slew a certain lion that Guy had rescued
from a dragon, and which thereafter followed him as a
faithful and grateful companion. This act so enraged
Guy that in a quarrel he killed the treacherous steward.
He then decided to leave Constantinople. When the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>emperor saw that it was not in his power to retain him,
he wept and all the court wept with him. Then he brought
forth his treasures and bade Guy to take whatever might
please him, but he would accept nothing. Guy’s companions,
however, were in a receptive mood, and the
emperor gave them whatever they desired. And Guy
departed for England, leaving the hearts of the emperor,
the princess, and the people of Constantinople filled
with woe.</p>

<p>For an account of Tirant’s activities while in the service
of the Greek emperor, we beg to refer the reader to
the analysis. We shall, however, call his attention to the
following striking similarities between <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em>
and <em>Guy of Warwick</em>. In both these works the empire
is described as being in desperate straits. Guy went to
Constantinople with one hundred knights; Tirant, with
one hundred and forty. In both books the only son of the
emperor was slain. In the English romance, Esclandar
promised to his lady-love, the sultan’s daughter, the
head of Guy; in the Catalan work, the King of Egypt
expressed his intention of sending to his lady-love, the
Grand Turk’s daughter, the head of Tirant. Tirant
addressed his soldiers on various occasions, as did Guy
before the Greeks attacked the enemy. Guy, although
never formally appointed leader of the imperial army,
was intrusted with the defense of Constantinople; Tirant
was in full command of the forces of the emperor. Morgadour
cherished hopes of marrying the daughter of
His Imperial Majesty, harbored envy and ill will against
Guy, and tried to bring about his death; the Duke of
Macedonia was one of Carmesina’s suitors, hated Tirant,
and treacherously attacked him from behind in the
midst of battle. In both works the bells were rung when
there was cause for rejoicing. Both Guy and Tirant
were always successful in their encounters with the enemy.
In <em>Guy of Warwick</em> and in <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em> the emperor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
gave the hand of his daughter to the hero and publicly
announced him successor to the imperial throne. But
in neither case was the marriage consummated. Guy’s
perilous mission as ambassador to the sultan is reëchoed
in <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em>, but the scene takes place in Barbary.
Tirant went to King Scariano as ambassador of the
King of Tremicen, refused to salute him, for they were
enemies, and harshly rebuked him for making war against
the King of Tremicen. So he issued a challenge that
if any of Scariano’s knights should dare to say that the
war was just, he, the ambassador of the King of Tremicen,
would be pleased to maintain the contrary and engage
in mortal combat with that knight.</p>

<p>From the resemblances just pointed out, are we not
justified in challenging the statement that Tirant lo
Blanch represents Roger de Flor? Tirant’s activities at
Constantinople constitute the most important part of his
career, and this part is said to be based on the Catalan-Aragonese
expedition to Constantinople under the
leadership of that famous Catalan hero. Let us examine
closely the part of Muntaner’s <em>Chronica</em> which treats
of Roger de Flor and his expedition, in order that we may
see how closely Martorell followed the facts connected
with that glorious page in Catalan history.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III
<br />
<small>ROGER DE FLOR’S CAREER AT CONSTANTINOPLE</small></h3>


<p>Roger de Flor, with many soldiers and adventurers
from Catalonia and Aragon, had fought on the side of
Frederick I of Aragon, while the latter was engaged in
a war against Charles of Anjou, King of Naples, for the
possession of the kingdom of Sicily. When the war was
over, Roger and his companions in arms were without
employment. He then conceived the plan of entering
the service of the Emperor of Constantinople, who was
hard pressed by the Turks. Accordingly he sent two
trustworthy knights to the emperor, with instructions
and full powers to act for him. He offered his services
under the following conditions: that the emperor give
him his niece in marriage; that he appoint him Magaduch
of the empire; and that he pay to the soldiers who came
with Roger a stipulated wage. He felt certain that the
mission of his agents would be successful, and, even
before these returned, was busy making preparations
for the expedition. Finally they came back with the
espousals duly signed and Roger’s appointment and
commission as Magaduch. This title and position was
equal to that of prince, and carried with it command of
the soldiers of the empire and authority over the Admiral.
Roger, with the assistance of King Frederick, gathered
a fleet of thirty-six vessels, and in these, without counting
the crews, women, and children, 1500 cavalry and 5000
infantry set sail. On arriving at Constantinople they
were received with great joy. The marriage of Roger
and the emperor’s niece was celebrated without delay.
The Genoese who were fighting under the imperial banners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
were in an ugly mood when they saw with what
cordial welcome their rivals were received. Roger’s men
resented their insolence, and a bloody battle ensued in
which 3000 Genoese were slain. The emperor watched
the fight with pleasure, for the overbearing ways of the
Genoese had long been a source of extreme vexation to
him. Roger’s <em>almogávares</em> wished to sack Pera, where
the Genoese lived, and it was with difficulty that the new
Magaduch restrained them.</p>

<p>The Turks had conquered all the territory of Anatolia
and were so near the city of Constantinople that only
an arm of the sea separated them. Some time before
the arrival of Roger, Xor Miqueli,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> the eldest son of the
emperor, had crossed this body of water with 12,000
cavalry and 100,000 infantry, but he was afraid to join
battle with the Turks. The emperor now sent Roger
with his 1500 cavalry and 5000 infantry to attack the
enemy. But before the Magaduch set out he succeeded
in having his intimate friend, En Ferran de Ahones,
married to a relative of the emperor and at the same
time appointed Admiral. Then he took his forces across
the arm of the sea and landed near the camp of the
Turks, without having been seen by them. The next day
at dawn his forces made an unexpected attack on the
enemy, and a hard-fought battle ensued. The Turks were
unable to resist the terrific onslaught of the <em>almogávares</em>,
and finally were forced to yield, after having lost 3000
cavalry and 10,000 infantry. The news of the victory
brought great joy to the heart of the emperor, but to the
Genoese it was a bitter draught. Xor Miqueli, too, was
disappointed. From that time he frowned on Roger and
his men.</p>

<p>After this victory the Magaduch planned to reconquer
all the cities, towns, and castles that the Turks had captured.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>But a severe winter set in, and he was obliged
to go into winter quarters at Artaqui, where the above
battle had been fought. When the cold season was nearly
over he ordered all his men to be ready to follow the
banner on the first day of April, on which date the
army marched towards Filadelfia. Just before reaching
that city they came upon a Turkish army drawn up in
battle array. The battle that followed was stubbornly
fought on both sides, but finally the Magaduch’s forces
were victorious. They entered the city, where they were
warmly welcomed. From this place they went to Nif,
thence to Magnesia, and next to Tira. The morning
after they entered this city hostile troops appeared, and
the Magaduch sent out the Seneschal, En Corberan de
Alet, with a body of men, to attack them. The Turks
were soon routed and in pursuing them the Seneschal was
struck by an arrow and killed.</p>

<p>The Magaduch sent word to the Admiral to bring the
whole fleet to Ania. In the meantime En Berenguer
de Rocafort arrived at Constantinople with 200 cavalry
and 1000 infantry, and these were immediately sent to
the Magaduch. These reinforcements, the fleet, and the
forces in the field all came together at Ania. Rocafort
was made Seneschal. At this place another clash with
the enemy took place, and the latter was soon put to
flight. The victorious army then continued its march
through Anatolia, and when they arrived at a mountain
pass called “La Porta del Ferre,” they were attacked
by a large army of the enemy. The Turks fought furiously,
but in vain; they were forced to flee and the
victors pursued them until darkness intervened.</p>

<p>Finally the power of the Turks in Anatolia was completely
broken. Roger now asked the emperor to make
a payment to his troops, and the latter ordered special
money to be coined. This money was not worth its
face value. The emperor did this in order that friction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
and hatred might arise between the people of the empire
and the strangers, for “if he had not had need of these
foreigners, he would have wished all of them dead and
out of the empire.”</p>

<p>En Berenguer Dentença arrived with additional reinforcements.
A few days later Roger suggested to the
emperor that the newly-arrived commander should be
given a position of honor, and offered to resign his position
in order that Dentença might be appointed Magaduch.
His Imperial Majesty approved this suggestion. The
following day Roger placed his cap on the head of Dentença
and gave him the insignia of the high office of Magaduch.
Thereupon the emperor asked Roger to be seated and
proclaimed him Caesar of the Empire. Caesar’s throne
was a half-hand lower than the emperor’s, and his cap
and robes were blue instead of red. That constituted
the only difference between emperor and Caesar. There
had been no Caesar of the Empire for four hundred
years. Roger’s elevation to this dignity was celebrated
with great solemnity.</p>

<p>Another winter came on, and the Caesar spent it with
his troops at Gallipoli. After the Christmas festivities
he returned to Constantinople to confer with the emperor
in regard to affairs of the empire. As a result of this
consultation the whole territory of Anatolia and the
islands of Romania were placed in his hands. He was
to distribute the cities, towns, and castles among vassals,
who were to furnish armed men and horses in return.</p>

<p>But before going to Anatolia he felt it his duty to take
leave of Xor Miqueli, who was at Adrianople, five <em>jornadas</em>
from the imperial city. His wife and her mother,
knowing the hatred that the emperor’s son bore him,
warned him not to go there, but he went in spite of their
pleadings. Xor Miqueli came out to meet him and showed
him much honor. Apparently the fears of his wife and
her mother were unfounded. But on the seventh day of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
his visit Gircon, the chief of the Alanos, entered the
palace, and at the behest, or at least with the consent,
of Xor Miqueli, put a tragic end to the heroic career of
Roger de Flor, Caesar of the Empire.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now let us see what striking resemblances we can discover
in comparing the careers of Tirant lo Blanch and
Roger de Flor. The points of similarity that stand out
prominently in the comparison of these heroes are the
following: Tirant, like Roger de Flor, came from Sicily
to the aid of the ill-faring empire; both were immediately
placed in command of the imperial forces, Tirant with
the title of Capita Major and Roger de Flor with that
of Magaduch; both were always victorious on the field
of battle, and recovered the territory that had been
conquered by the Turks; both were made Caesar of
the Empire for their distinguished services; Roger was
assassinated at Adrianople, and in that same city Tirant’s
fatal malady seized him.</p>

<p>The historical basis of Tirant’s career at Constantinople
is evidently furnished by the <em>Chronica</em>, but Martorell’s
hero differs very much from the Catalan hero. The
author evidently had the latter in mind to some extent,
but apparently he did not wish to portray him in such
manner that one would recognize him. While we still
have Guy of Warwick’s career at Constantinople fresh
in mind, do not the details of Tirant’s career seem to
be more in accord with the English hero’s than with those
of Roger de Flor? Did we not expect more of a resemblance,
when we were told that Tirant represents the
latter? In short, is that judgment not misleading? If
it had been Martorell’s intention to make this part a kind
of historical novel in which Roger de Flor was to be the
central figure, would he not have adhered to the facts
more closely, and elaborated them at his own free will and
pleasure?</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV
<br />
<small>OTHER MATERIAL FROM THE <em>CHRONICA</em> UTILIZED
BY MARTORELL</small></h3>


<p>But there are other features in this part of <em>Tirant
lo Blanch</em> that reveal the influence of that portion of the
<em>Chronica</em> which treats of Roger de Flor and his expedition.
In recounting the career of the latter we have noted that
the first fight in which his forces were engaged was against
the Genoese, who were in the service of the emperor.
This incident is reflected in the following words spoken
by the emperor and addressed to Tirant:<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> “... perqueus
prech, Capita virtuos, queus vullau dispondre en
anar contra los enemichs nostres los genouesos, generacio
mala....”</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_47_47" id="Footnote_47_47"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47_47">[47]</a> Therefore I pray you, excellent Captain, to make ready to
march against our enemies, the Genoese, an evil race.... <em>Tirant
lo Blanch</em>, chap. cxxii, col. 2.</p></div>

<p>The incompetent, envious and treacherous commander,
Xor Miqueli, is probably the prototype of the sullen and
malicious Duke of Macedonia.</p>

<p>En Berenguer de Rocafort and En Berenguer Dentença
came with reinforcements to Constantinople and joined
Roger’s army; the Prior of Saint John, the Viscount
of Branches, and the Duke of Messina came with many
men to join Tirant’s forces.</p>

<p>At a session of the Imperial Council which had convened
to consider certain military matters, one of the
members proposed:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> ... antes que partixquen de açi la gent darmes

Elena: e perço hagueren en temps antich los
Grechs victoria dels Troyans.
</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_48_48" id="Footnote_48_48"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48_48">[48]</a> ... before they leave here, the men at arms ought to make
a pilgrimage and make great offerings to the gods on the island
whence Paris carried away Queen Helen: it was in this way that,
in ancient times, the Greeks won a victory over the Trojans. <em>Tirant
lo Blanch</em>, chap. cxxiii, col. 4.</p></div>

<p>This proposal is surprising. Why should such a suggestion
be made in a Christian court? We find the answer
in the following passage taken from the <em>Chronica</em>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> E en aquella illa del Tenedo en aquell temps

Arena, muller del duch de Tenes, hi vench en romeria
ab C cauallers qui lacompanyaren, e Paris,
fill del rey Priam de Troya, axi mateix era vengut

E vae la dona Arena, e altas tant della, que dix

<p><a name="Footnote_49_49" id="Footnote_49_49"></a><a href="#FNanchor_49_49">[49]</a> And on that island of Tenedos, there was at that time an idol,
and one month in every year all the noble men and noble ladies
of Romania came thither on a pilgrimage. And thus it was that
at that time Arena [Helen] wife of the Duke of Tenes [Athens?]
came thither on a pilgrimage with a hundred knights who accompanied
her. And Paris, the son of King Priam of Troy, likewise
had come on a pilgrimage and he had with him about fifty knights.
He saw the Lady Arena, and fell so deeply in love with her that he
said to his men that he must have her and carry her away with
him. And what he had set his heart upon doing was done: he made
ready to carry out his purpose with his company, and he seized the
lady and was about to take her away. And those knights who were
with her tried to defend her, and finally every one of the hundred
was killed and Paris carried away the lady. Muntaner’s <em>Chronica</em>,
chap. ccxiv.</p>
</div>

<p>Roger’s companion, En Fernan de Ahones, married
a relative of the emperor and was appointed Admiral;
Tirant’s intimate companion, Diaphebus, became Constable
and married the niece of the emperor, Stephania.</p>

<p>The above are the principal features that seem to owe
their origin to that part of the <em>Chronica</em> that treats of
Roger de Flor in connection with the Catalan-Aragonese
expedition to the Orient. Another feature which is apparently
due to the same source is the description of the
manner in which Tirant ran the blockade at Rhodes.
The description is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><a name="Footnote_50_50" id="Footnote_50_50"></a><a href="#FNanchor_50_50">[50]</a> And in the first watch the ship set sail: they left the port in
very good weather and they had very favorable winds so that in
four days they crossed the Gulf of Venice and were in sight of Rhodes.
They went to the castle of Saint Peter, where they cast anchor in
order to await a rather stormy wind. Tirant followed the advice
of two mariners whom he had brought along with him from his
native land. Both of these held his honor in high esteem. When
they saw that the wind was strong and propitious they set sail
during the night and in the morning at break of day they were
very near Rhodes. When the ships of the Genoese saw that vessel
coming they thought that it was one of two that they had sent to
get provisions for the camp, and seeing that they were coming from
the west, they could not imagine that any other ship would have
the boldness to come into the midst of so many ships as were
in the port. The vessel approached and when it was very close to
them, all the sails that it was able to carry were set. By this and
by the lines of the ship the Genoese saw that it was none of theirs
and they put themselves in order the best they could: but the vessel
was so near them that no ship was able to set a sail, and that one
with sails full spread passed through the midst of all the ships in
spite of them. <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em>, chap. ciiii, cols. 3 and 4.</p>

<p>When Robert, Duke of Catania, besieged the city of
Messina in Sicily, Roger de Flor brought provisions to
the starving soldiers and inhabitants, and the duke was
obliged to raise the siege. Below follows the account of
this event as narrated by Muntaner.</p>

them with grain at Sciacca and came to Syracuse and waited for a
strong wind to come up from the southeast or south. And when
the wind came it was so strong that the whole sea began to rage,
so that no man who was not so good a mariner as he, dared think
of setting sail. He set sail from Syracuse when night had come, and
at dawn he entered the Strait of Faro; and it is the greatest wonder
in the world that anything can survive in the Strait of Faro when
there is a strong wind from the southeast or the south, for the
currents there are so powerful and the sea rages so violently that
nothing can stand it. And he decided to enter first with his own
galley provided with large sails in which there were holes. And
when the galleys of the duke saw them, all began to shout and they
wished to raise the anchors but they were unable to do so. And thus
the ten galleys with Brother Roger entered the harbor of Messina
safely and securely, but there was not a man who had on him a
dry thread ... and thus Messina was relieved and the next day
the duke raised the siege and returned to Catania. <em>Chronica</em>,
chap. cxcvi.</p></div>

<p>The above comparative study of <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em>
and that part of Muntaner’s <em>Chronica</em> that deals with
Roger de Flor and the Catalan-Aragonese expedition
presents strong evidence that Martorell was acquainted
with Muntaner’s work. But yet what a difference!
Were it not for the fact that Tirant reconquered practically
all the lost territory of the Greek empire and was
made Caesar of the empire, we should hardly associate
his name with that of Roger de Flor. Such being the
case, are not the statements that Roger de Flor’s career
forms the principal source of this book rather misleading?
However that may be, we are willing to admit that the
martial and adventurous spirit of Roger de Flor and the
members of his expedition finds expression in <em>Tirant lo
Blanch</em>, and this constitutes the strongest resemblance.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V
<br />
<small>OTHER MATERIAL FROM GUY OF WARWICK</small></h3>


<p>But let us now return to the English romance, for
it contains other features that have been reproduced or
at least utilized in the composition of the Catalan book
of chivalry. The Auchinleck MS. contains a kind of
sequel to <em>Guy of Warwick</em>, which bears the title, <em>Reinbrun,
Gij sone of Warwicke</em>. In this sequel we are
told that Reinbrun was stolen by foreign merchants.
Heraud, the faithful companion of Guy before the latter’s
pilgrimage, went in search of the lad, and while he was
on his way to Constantinople a tempest drove to the
shores of Africa the ship on which he was making the
voyage. There the Saracens seized him and brought
him before Emir Persan, who ordered him to be thrown
into prison. In a doleful lament Heraud spoke of himself
as a doughty knight, and this was overheard by a
keeper, who reported it to the emir. Now it happened
that at that very time King Argus was making war upon
Persan, and had captured all his possessions except the
very city in which Heraud was held a prisoner. The
emir sent for Heraud and asked him to assist in the defense
of the city. His request was granted, and in the
first battle with the enemy he fought so skillfully and so
valiantly that Persan rewarded him by making him his
steward.</p>

<p>The reader will readily see the striking resemblance
between this incident and that part of the analysis which
deals with the shipwreck of Tirant on the shores of Barbary.
Tirant, like Heraud, was driven by a tempest
to the hostile shores of Africa, cast into prison, released<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
therefrom because of his fighting abilities, and practically
became the leader of an army which was on the
defensive. This incident Martorell then developed, and
Tirant finally became the conqueror of Barbary.</p>

<p>In the analysis we have told how Tirant went to Jerusalem
and from there to Alexandria, where he ransomed
Christian captives. It seems probable that this incident
is based upon the following narrative of the English
romance. Guy of Warwick made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem,
and from there he went to Antioch. Here he met
a pilgrim who was in great distress. It was Earl Jonas
of Darras, who related to Guy how he, his fifteen sons,
and others had fought a body of Saracens and had defeated
them. They pursued them as far as Alexandria, when
suddenly a strong band of the enemy attacked him and
his men, and after a heroic but useless fight he was compelled
to surrender.</p>

<p>And thus they fell into the hands of Triamour, King
of Alexandria. Earl Jonas then told how the sultan
held a great festival which was attended by this king
and his son, Fabour. The latter killed the son of the sultan
over a game of chess. The sultan promised the
king that if he should engage in combat with the black
giant, Amoraunt, and slay him, both he and his son
should go unpunished. Triamour asked for a respite in
order that he might find a substitute, and it was granted.
He asked his prisoner, Earl Jonas, if he knew any one
who might be able to slay the giant. The names of Guy
and Heraud were mentioned. The king then sent him in
quest of these knights, promising him that if he should
be able to bring either one of them, he and his fifteen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>sons should regain their liberty, but if, on the other
hand, he returned without Guy or Heraud, they should
all be hanged. Jonas had made a diligent search for the
English knights, not only on the continent, but even
in England. Alas! it was all in vain. The period of
the respite was one year and forty days, and the end of
the term was near. Guy, without revealing his identity,
offered to undertake the fight with the giant. They
went to Alexandria and Guy was presented to the king
as a pilgrim who was willing to meet the black giant
in mortal combat. In response to the king’s invocation,
“Mahoun me helpe and turmegaunte,” Guy replied:</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_53_53" id="Footnote_53_53"></a><a href="#FNanchor_53_53">[53]</a> Caius MS., p. 451.</p></div>

<p>The combat took place at the sultan’s court. When
Guy beheld the horrible giant, he declared that it was the
devil and no man. After a long and fierce fight, Guy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>cut off his adversary’s right arm, then his left, and finally
his head. Let the reader note the following coincidences:
Guy and Tirant both made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem;
from there they came to Alexandria; the ransom of
prisoners is mentioned in <em>Guy of Warwick</em>, and the ransom
of captives is a fact in <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em>. Martorell did
not reproduce this story, but he seems to have retained
the words Jerusalem, Alexandria, and ransom of Christians,
and from these he developed his own story. In
the lines quoted above, Guy’s fervent religious spirit
is brought into prominence, and at the same time a
struggle for supremacy between the Christian and the
Mohammedan religions is suggested. In <em>Tirant lo
Blanch</em> also, the hero is filled with religious zeal and
fervor, and under his leadership Christianity triumphs
in all Barbary.</p>

<p>We have pointed out above the more important points
of resemblance in <em>Guy of Warwick</em> and <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em>.
Let us now mention a few of the minor ones.</p>

<p>In the English romance, the following words are spoken
of Felice:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">She was therto curteys and free ywys,</div>
<div class="i0">And in the .vii. arts well learned withoute mys.</div>

<p><a name="Footnote_54_54" id="Footnote_54_54"></a><a href="#FNanchor_54_54">[54]</a> Caius MS., p. 7.</p></div>

<p>In <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em> the empress confesses that she cannot
argue as well as Carmesina, “per yo no hauer studiat
les liberals arts com ma filla.”<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

has. <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em>, chap. clxxxii, col. 2.</p></div>

<p>When Guy made his confession of love to Felice, he
said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Bot thou haue mercy on me,</div>
<div class="i0">Myself y shall for sorwe slee.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_56_56" id="Footnote_56_56"></a><a href="#FNanchor_56_56">[56]</a> Caius MS., p. 23.</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">When Tirant made his confession to the princess, he said:
“puix lo meu cor ha tant fallit que es stat causador de
tant agreujar la vostra singular persona e percaçar tant
de mal per a mi, ab la mia ma plena de cruel vengança
ans que lo sol haja passat los columnes de Hercules yol

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_57_57" id="Footnote_57_57"></a><a href="#FNanchor_57_57">[57]</a> ... since my heart has been so delinquent that it has been the
cause of afflicting so grievously your excellent personage and producing
so much pain through me, with my hand full of cruel
vengeance I shall cut it in two before the sun has passed the columns
of Hercules. <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em>, chap. cxxix, col. 3.</p></div>

<p>In <em>Guy of Warwick</em>, Oisel beholds her betrothed, Tirri,
lying before her as if dead, and in her despair she utters
these words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">A, leman Tirri,</div>
<div class="i0">In wroched time mi bodi thou say,</div>
<div class="i0">When thou shalt for me day.</div>
<div class="i0">Dye ich-il forth with the:</div>
<div class="i0">For sorwe lives no may y be.</div>
<div class="i0">Bot y may dye ichil me quelle:</div>
<div class="i0">Len to libbe is nought mi wille.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_58_58" id="Footnote_58_58"></a><a href="#FNanchor_58_58">[58]</a> Auchinleck MS., p. 278.</p></div>

<p>Let us compare with these lines the words of Carmesina,
while lamenting over the lifeless body of Tirant:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Puix la fortuna ha ordenat, e vol que axi sia, los
meus ulls no deuen james alegrarse, sino que vull
anar a cercar lanima de aquell qui solia esser meu
Tirant en los lochs benaventurats hon reposa la
sua anima si trobar la pore: e certament ab tu
vull fer companyia en la mort.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_59_59" id="Footnote_59_59"></a><a href="#FNanchor_59_59">[59]</a> Since fortune has ordained and wills it so, my eyes will never
more be gladdened, but I will go to seek the soul of him who used
to be my Tirant in the blissful places where his soul reposes if I
can find it: and indeed I wish to be thy companion in death.
<em>Tirant lo Blanch</em>, chap. cccclxxiii, col. 2.</p></div>

<p>And in another lamentation she utters these words:
“Si la sperança de morir nom detingues, yom mataria.”<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_60_60" id="Footnote_60_60"></a><a href="#FNanchor_60_60">[60]</a> ... if the hope of dying did not deter me, I should kill myself.
<em>Ibid.</em>, chap. cccclxxv, col. 1.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>In the analysis we have observed how Carmesina
pleaded with Tirant not to permit his amorous nature
to interfere with his martial spirit. In the English
romance, Felice justifies her attitude towards Guy in the
following manner:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">And if y the had mi loue yiue</div>
<div class="i0">And wille it the whiles y liue</div>

<div class="i0">That thou woldest nomore armes doon,</div>
<div class="i0">Ne come in turnement nor in fighte.</div>

<p>We have described in the analysis the scene in which
Carmesina throws herself on the corpse of Tirant. Let
us compare with it the following lines which picture
to us the grief of Felice at Guy’s death.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">She sowned on her lordys bere,</div>
<div class="i0">And kyst hys mouth with wepying chere.</div>

<p>The love story in <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em> forms an important
part of the book. Surely the origin of this feature cannot
be attributed to the career of Roger de Flor. On the
contrary, the above comparative study presents strong
evidence that the love affair between Tirant and Carmesina
was developed by Martorell from elements drawn
from <em>Guy of Warwick</em>. But unfortunately the author
ascribed to the Capita Major so passionate a nature that
in some of the love scenes we are disgusted at the
actions of the protagonist. The character of Tirant is
admirable in almost all respects, but in the pursuit of
his immoral desires it is detestable. In our amazement
and disappointment we ask ourselves why the author
endowed his hero with such low and immoral cravings.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>Tirant’s conduct towards the princess reminds us of a
passage in the English romance wherein the treacherous
steward, Morgadour, falsely accuses Guy of having dishonored
the daughter of the Emperor of Constantinople.
The passage reads as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Sir, quoth he, y shall the telle:</div>
<div class="i0">Thy shame noo lenger couere y nelle.</div>
<div class="i0">A souldiour thou hast with the,</div>
<div class="i0">That thinketh for to shende the.</div>
<div class="i0">Thy doughter, that so fair is,</div>
<div class="i0">He hath leyn by, ywis.</div>
<div class="i0">In-to hir boure with strength he yede:</div>
<div class="i0">By thy doughter his wille he dede.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_63_63" id="Footnote_63_63"></a><a href="#FNanchor_63_63">[63]</a> Caius MS., p. 187.</p></div>

<p>This incident may have prompted Martorell to ascribe
to Tirant the rôle of a passionate lover, and we feel that
he adopted the suggestion without any hesitation whatever.
Boccaccio’s influence was powerful in those days,
and the incident afforded great possibilities for emulating
the famous Italian writer. If this conjecture be true,
our censure of the author must be limited to a reproach
for having so easily and so shamelessly followed that
influence. But Martorell keeps in close touch with
real life. It may be that such conduct of knights had
come to his notice directly or indirectly. If that is the
reason why the obscene features were introduced, our
condemnation will not be extremely severe. But if
it was his purpose to present to us an ideal hero, then
the author is deserving of the most scathing denunciation
possible, for he must have been as morally weak as the
hero he asks us to admire. He seems to take a delight
in describing unbecoming and immoral scenes. Not
only does he give vivid narrations of Tirant’s efforts
to attain the “compliment de amor,” but he also makes
bold descriptions of the liaison between the empress
and Hypolite; the relations of Diaphebus and Stephania;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>and the revolting plan by which Viuda Reposada succeeded
in making Tirant believe that Carmesina was
unfaithful. But we may be doing the author a grave
injustice. Possibly these immoral scenes were intended
to have a moral effect. It may have been the purpose
of Martorell to disgust the readers with these scenes.
Possibly it was a protest against the immoral conditions
that prevailed in his time.</p>

<p>After making the above comparative study, we are not
willing to accept the statement of Amador de los Ríos,
so emphatically repeated by Givanel Mas, that the feats
of Roger de Flor form the principal source of the Catalan
book of chivalry. Nor will we accept the opinion of
Denk that <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em> represents nothing else
but the figure of Roger de Flor reproduced in the form of
a novel. To the conservative statement of Menéndez
y Pelayo we shall offer no serious objections, for the
latter part of <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em> does bear the stamp of
a kind of historical novel in which the heroic expedition
of the Catalans and Aragonese and the tragic fate of
Roger de Flor is more or less faithfully reflected. But
we feel that the resemblance between Roger de Flor
and Tirant lo Blanch and their military enterprises is
so slight that even his statement must be qualified as
misleading. However, had he stated that Tirant’s
activities at Constantinople had a true historical basis,
and that basis was Roger de Flor’s expedition to the
Orient, we should most heartily indorse that statement.</p>

<p>If we have objected to the intimations and declarations
that this book of chivalry is a historical novel based on
the exploits of Roger de Flor, it is due to the fact that
the real deeds of that hero play a very insignificant part
in it. Roger de Flor was a brave commander with a
remarkable genius for organizing his forces, and for
planning campaigns. Muntaner does not describe him
a single time as fighting hand to hand in a battle with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
enemy. The historical Roger de Flor probably would
not have created enough interest and enthusiasm. Moreover,
in Tirant’s adventures and fights on the sea, whenever
some extraordinary naval strategy was necessary, the
credit for it is not given to Tirant, but to some member
of the crew who is usually described as an experienced
seaman. And yet Roger de Flor was so efficient a sea
captain that the officers of the Temple intrusted him
with their largest ship. If the author had intended
to represent him, surely he would not have denied him
the honor of those exploits. It is obvious that he did
not regard his hero as an experienced mariner. The
hero he had in mind was a knight whose duty called him
to the battlefield. Tirant lo Blanch bears a far stronger
resemblance to Guy of Warwick than to Roger de Flor.
The striking points of similarity of these characters
have already been noted. In addition to these points,
we may briefly add that Tirant’s religious zeal; his
generosity; his refusal to accept rewards; his fighting
in tournaments, in personal combats, and on the field
of battle; and his love—debased unfortunately—are
qualities that are not mentioned in connection with Roger
de Flor, but they are all in accord with the career of
Guy of Warwick. Such being the case, would it not
be far more accurate to say that <em>Guy of Warwick</em> is
the principal source? The very beginning of <em>Tirant
lo Blanch</em> indicates that its author was intimately acquainted
with the English romance. Is it not probable
that Guy of Warwick’s activities at Constantinople
reminded Martorell of Roger de Flor’s heroic services
to the emperor of that same city, whereupon he selected
that historical event as a background for a certain part
of the career of his hero? It must be remembered that
Martorell knew well the exploits of the brave and adventurous
soldiers of the Catalan-Aragonese expedition.
His conception of military heroism was in great part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
based on the history, traditional or written, of his people.
The spirit that animated its heroes became a part of him,
and consequently it was but natural that that spirit
should find expression in a literary production in which
a military hero is portrayed.</p>

<p>From the above comparative study of <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em>
in relation to its sources, viz., Lull’s <em>Libre del Orde
d’Cauayleria</em>, Muntaner’s <em>Chronica</em>, and the English
romance, <em>Guy of Warwick</em>, we are convinced that these
sources have furnished important ideas and material to
Martorell. The features drawn from Lull’s work are
few, but, on the other hand, they have been subjected
to very little change. It is important, however, for it
seems to have provided a starting point for the author.
Guy of Warwick has yielded more concrete material
than the other two sources, but it has been modified to
suit the pleasure and to meet the needs of the author.
Muntaner’s <em>Chronica</em> did not furnish as many ideas and
suggestions as <em>Guy of Warwick</em>, but the martial spirit
of the Catalan and Aragonese warriors pervades a large
part of the work.</p>

<p>It is not in our power to divine with certainty the
plan as originally conceived by the author when he began
his work. However, it is evident that he was intimately
acquainted with Lull’s work and the English romance
from the very beginning. It is quite probable that
Martorell’s purpose was to make a hero of the squire
who had received instructions pertaining to knighthood
from the hermit, as related by Lull. This hermit reminded
him of Guy of Warwick, whom he greatly admired, and
he could not resist the temptation to reproduce that
part of the English champion’s career which led to his
retirement to a hermitage. Then, as we have already
observed, the squire who is now Tirant lo Blanch meets
the hermit, William of Warwick, after which he continues
his way to the English court. A little more than a year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
later he returns to the hermit, and the latter is informed
of the important events that took place in London.
After a few days’ sojourn, Tirant returns to his native
land, Brittany. His career is very promising, for he has
been proclaimed the greatest knight in the exercises of
arms at the English court. And now what is the young
hero to do? Martorell had perhaps from the beginning
of his work rather definite ideas in regard to his hero’s
career. Still it is quite possible that he had made no
fixed plan in advance, but selected the various spheres
of Tirant’s activities during the course of the composition
of his book. However that may be, Tirant’s career
finally resolved itself into the following distinct spheres
of operation: he succored the Knights of St. John on the
island of Rhodes; after that, he joined the expedition of
the King of France against the infidels; then he went to
the aid of the Emperor of Constantinople; next he conquered
and christianized Barbary; and finally he returned
to Constantinople and reconquered all the lost
territory of the Grecian empire. And now the question
arises: Are all these various spheres of operation based
on real historical events?</p>

<h2>PART IV
<br />
<small>THE HISTORICAL BASES UPON WHICH
TIRANT’S SPHERES OF OPERATION
ARE FOUNDED</small></h2>



<h3>CHAPTER I
<br />
<small>THE WILLIAM OF WARWICK EPISODE</small></h3>


<p>In the preceding part, wherein was made a comparative
study of three important sources of <em>Tirant to Blanch</em>,
we have had occasion to mention the real historical facts
that form, in a more or less general way, the basis of
Tirant’s career while in the service of the Emperor of
Constantinople. Let us now transfer our researches to the
field of history and try to determine what historical
events underlie the hero’s various undertakings. Let us,
moreover, examine all the features of <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em>
that give any indication of historical influence, in order
that we may attain a better understanding of the author’s
method in composing this work. The first question that
confronts us is: What historical basis is to be found in
the William of Warwick episode?</p>

<p>The hero of the English romance of <em>Guy of Warwick</em>
is more or less a legendary personage. John Rous, a
learned scholar and writer who lived between 1411 and
1491, in his writings concerning the legendary history
of Warwickshire, names Guy as the second of the Saxon
Earls of Warwick. We cannot cite any authentic historical
facts about him. The story probably represents
an old Saxon legend, perhaps in the form of a ballad,
which in the course of time became a romance in French,
and this was later translated into English. In the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
fourteenth-century versions to which we have referred
in Part III of this work, Aethelstan is represented as the
King of England. This fixes the supposed time of Guy’s
career as prior to 940, which marks the end of Aethelstan’s
reign. The latter annexed Danish Northumbria,
and, in 937, won the great battle of Brunanburh over the
Danes, Scots, and Strathclyde Britons. This fact shows
that there are at least some traces of authentic history
in the romance, for in <em>Guy of Warwick</em> we read of an
invasion of the Danes.</p>

<p>In <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em>, no dates are mentioned so that
if we wish to establish the period in which the events
described took place, we shall have to depend on the
historical characters that are named, and the incidents,
occurrences, and events that are narrated. The data that
we may gather for this purpose probably will throw
light on other matters in which we are interested.</p>

<p>The document that was given to Tirant in which he
was declared the best knight of all those that participated
in the exercises of arms at the English court was
signed “Rex Enricus.” This king was young and
feeble, and for that reason the hermit William of Warwick
suggested that the Duke of Lancaster should take
the place of the king in the approaching personal combat
with the strong and valiant Moorish king of Canary;
but the suggestion caused loud protests from the Dukes
of Gloucester, Bedford, and Exeter, who claimed that their
kinship to the king was closer than that of the Duke
of Lancaster. It is quite clear that the author had in
mind the English king, Henry VI, who during his minority
was represented by his two uncles, the Duke of Bedford
as protector of the realm, and the Duke of Gloucester
as regent in England while the protector was in France.
The Duke of Exeter was the grand-uncle of the young
king. There was no Duke of Lancaster at that particular
period. Richard de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
was closely associated with the boy-king. When Henry V
was on his deathbed, he sent for the earl and asked
him to be the master of his son, the future Henry VI,
requesting him at the same time “to be gentle with
him and guide and instruct him in the condition of life
to which he belonged.”<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Henry V died in 1422, and the
Earl of Warwick became the tutor and governor of the
new king, although that title was not conferred upon him
until 1428. The coincidence is striking! In the story
William of Warwick was the fatherly adviser of the young
English king, and in history Richard of Warwick was the
tutor and governor of the English boy-king. And here
the question arises: Could Martorell have had in mind
Richard de Beauchamp when he wrote certain parts of
his work?</p>

York and London, 1903; vol. I, p. 121.</p></div>

<p>Let us here give a brief account of the career of Richard
de Beauchamp. Upon his father’s death in 1401, he
became Earl of Warwick, being at that time twenty
years old. His early years were spent chiefly in performing
feats of arms, as did the knights of old. At the
coronation of Queen Jane he defended the field against
all those that dared to joust with him. Not finding
sufficient opportunities for knightly exercises and adventures
at home, he went abroad. He made a pilgrimage
to Rome and from there went to Verona, where he engaged
in a joust with another knight. After the jousting they
fought with axes, next with swords, and finally with
daggers. From Verona he went to Venice and then to
Jerusalem. There the sultan’s lieutenant, upon being
informed that Richard was a descendant of Guy of Warwick
of whom he had read in books in his own language,
entertained him royally, and gave him precious gifts.
Richard then made his way overland to England, frequently
interrupting his journey by taking part in tournaments.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>Shortly after his return, he was sent to the town
of Calais and made Captain of that place. Longing
for a little excitement, he made up a tournament of his
own. Three days in succession, mounted on his caparisoned
steed, he went out on the field, and each day he
returned victorious. Later he was sent as ambassador
to Constance in Germany, to attend the well-known
Council of Constance. There he was challenged by some
great duke, who was slain in the encounter. The German
emperor expressed his admiration for him by saying
that “no Christian prince hath such another knight for
Wisdom, Nurture, and Manhood; that if all courtesy
were lost, yet it might be found again in him.”<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> His
principal military activities were in the war against the
French. In 1416 he was sent to relieve Harfleur; was
at the siege of Caen; captured several places; was made
Captain of Beauvais; and was present at the siege of
Rouen. When that city finally fell, the capitulation
was made to him. He was appointed to several offices
at home and abroad, his last and most important one
being the Governorship of France and Normandy. In
the year 1439 he died in the castle of Rouen at the age of
fifty-eight.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_65_65" id="Footnote_65_65"></a><a href="#FNanchor_65_65">[65]</a> <em>Ibid.</em>, vol. I, p. 113.</p></div>

<p>A strong resemblance between Richard de Beauchamp
and Guy of Warwick is evident. Is it not probable that
this similarity was to some degree instrumental in causing
Martorell to give the William of Warwick episode a
setting of the fifteenth century? There are several references
made to deeds of William of Warwick which cannot
be found in the English romance, <em>Guy of Warwick</em>. One of
them, however, concerns without doubt Richard de Beauchamp.
When the hermit-king told the countess where
the arms were that he desired, she begged him to reveal to
her how he happened to know so much about her husband.
He answered that he was with the earl when the latter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>as Capita Major of the city of Rouen, won a signal victory
over the large army of the French king. Richard
de Beauchamp was a popular hero, and if Martorell had
been in England, as he claims in his dedicatory letter,
he might have heard of many feats of the great knight
and soldier that are not recorded in history. However,
we have already learned the method of our author, and
we must not expect too many historical data on any
subject. But, as a rule, he gives us sufficient real facts
to determine what events or periods in history he has
in mind. Other historical personages cited in connection
with the William of Warwick episode are the Earl of
Salisbury, the Earl of Northumberland, the Duke of
Clarence, and the Prince of Wales. These names also
indicate that the historical period represented is the first
half of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>When Tirant asked the hermit to name the greatest
living knights in England, the latter gave the names of
Sir John Stuart and the Duke of Exeter. History mentions
but one great knight named John Stuart, and
he was of this period. From 1419 to the time of his
death in 1429, Sir John Stuart of Darnley was fighting
valiantly on the continent on the side of the French.
Charles VII appreciated his worth, and rewarded him
several times: first he granted him the seigneurie of
Aubigny in Berry, next the comté of Evreux in Normandy,
and finally the “glorious privilege of quartering
the Royal arms of France with his paternal arms of
Stuart.” He fell fighting bravely in a battle near Orleans.
In the well-known old French play, “Le Mistère
du Siège d’Orléans,” written some time after his death,
the following tribute is paid to him:</p>

<p class="no-indent">Martorell did well to name him as one of the greatest
knights of that period.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Beaufort, Duke of Exeter, also was a great
warrior. He rendered distinguished services to the
English nation in the struggle with France. He was
made Duke of Exeter in 1416, and in the same year
appointed Lieutenant of Normandy. He died at Greenwich
in 1427.</p>

<p>Thus we see that Martorell has reproduced the latter
part of the <em>Guy of Warwick</em> story, but has given it a
setting in the fifteenth century. It has been changed
considerably, and the historical personage, Richard de
Beauchamp, has had some influence in giving form to
this reproduction. The career of this great knight
reveals that the exploits of Tirant at the English court
were not the result of a vivid imagination, but, on the
contrary, were based in great part on knightly customs
and practices of the times. Martorell is a realist;
when he describes anything, it is usually based on something
that he had observed directly, or something that
he had read or heard related which impressed him as
having really occurred. It is true that occasionally we
find the narration of some incredible incidents in his
work, but it is hardly probable that he expected us to
believe them. It is owing to the realistic temperament
of the author that the different enterprises of Tirant are
based on historical events. He had a remarkable talent
for selecting interesting elements, and joining them so as
to produce an artistic whole. It was evidently not his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>purpose to make any part of his work an accurate narration
of some historical event. He distorts facts or
makes use of them under conditions different from those
under which they originally happened. Heroic deeds
that called forth his admiration, and historical incidents
that were interesting to him and of such a nature that
he could utilize them in the work that he had undertaken,
furnished him with an abundance of material for
his book of chivalry. <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em> is indeed a composite
work, made up of elements gathered here and
there, logically connected and fashioned into a consistent
whole which impresses the reader with a feeling of reality,
because it is based, in the main, on actual experiences and
happenings in life.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II
<br />
<small>CONCERNING THE ORDER OF THE GARTER</small></h3>


<p>With regard to the duration of the festivities connected
with the marriage of the King of England to the daughter
of the King of France, and concerning the time of the departure
of Tirant from London, we read in chapter xxxix:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>Lo dia de Sanct Joan principiaren les festes

duraren aquestes festes un any e un dia. Complides
les festes lo rey hague complit son matrimoni
ab la infanta de França. E tots les
strangers prengueren comiat del rey e de la
reyna, e cascu sen torna en ses terres. Tirant
apres que fon partit de la Ciutat de Londres ab
sos companyons fon en recort de la promesa
que hauia feta al pare hermita.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_67_67" id="Footnote_67_67"></a><a href="#FNanchor_67_67">[67]</a> The festivities began on the day of St. John and that day the
king was married to the Infanta: those festivities continued for
a year and a day. When the celebration was over the king had
consummated his marriage with the Infanta of France. And all
the foreigners took leave of the king and queen, and each one returned
to his own country. Tirant, after having left the city of
London with his companions, remembered the promise which he
had made to the hermit.</p></div>

<p>But in chapter lxxxv, Diaphebus, while telling the hermit
about the Order of the Garter, speaks these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>Ia era passat lany e lo dia: e les festes eran
complides de solemnizar com la magestat del

la qual nouament hauia instituida de .xxvi.

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_68_68" id="Footnote_68_68"></a><a href="#FNanchor_68_68">[68]</a> And now the year and a day had passed and the celebration
of the festivities was over, when His Royal Majesty sent word to
the noble visitors praying them to delay their departure for several
days: for His Royal Majesty wished to proclaim the institution of
a fraternity which he had recently founded, with a membership
of twenty-six knights, each of whom was without reproach. And
all were highly pleased to stay.</p></div>

<p>These conflicting statements as to the time of Tirant’s
leaving London indicate that when the author wrote
chapter xxxix, he had no intention of introducing the
account concerning the Order of the Garter. But later
moved probably by a desire to show in what great honor
Tirant was held, and to describe the pomp, magnificence,
and glory of knighthood, he decided to introduce this
feature. Still it is quite possible that the peculiar and
interesting stories in connection with the Order may have
caused its introduction. The circumstances which led
to the institution of the fraternity according to Martorell
are as follows:</p>

<p>At a dance at the English court a lady named Madresilva
lost a garter while she was dancing. A certain
knight picked it up. The King witnessed the incident,
and asked the knight to bring it to him and fasten it
on his left leg just below the knee. His Majesty wore
the garter in that way for four months and no one
ventured to speak to him concerning it. But one day
one of the maids, who was a favorite of the King, told
him that the Queen, the maids of honor, the people of the
kingdom and those from abroad, all were displeased that
he should show so much honor to Madresilva. And the
King answered:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_69_69" id="Footnote_69_69"></a><a href="#FNanchor_69_69">[69]</a> “So then the queen is displeased with that, and the foreigners
and those of my kingdom are surprised at it.” Then he spoke the
following words in French: “Punished be he who thinks evil of
it. Now I promise God,” said the king, “I shall institute and
build upon this incident an order of knighthood, and this fraternity
and order that I shall found will be remembered as long as the
world shall last.” <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em>, chap. lxxxv, col. 3.</p></div>

<p>In Elias Ashmole’s voluminous work,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> published in
1672, the above incident is related in the following manner:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_70_70" id="Footnote_70_70"></a><a href="#FNanchor_70_70">[70]</a> Elias Ashmole, <em>The Institution, Laws and Ceremonies of the
most Noble Order of the Garter</em>, London, 1672.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“As to the occasion of its institution, the vulgar and
more general opinion is, That the garter of Joane, Countess
of Salisbury, falling casually off, as she danced in a solemn
ball, King Edward hastily stooping, took it up from the
ground; whereupon some of the Nobles and Courtiers
smiling as at an amorous action, and he observing their
sportive humor, turned it off with this reply in French,
‘Honi soit qui mal y pense’; but withal added in disdain
of their laughter, That in a short time, they should
see that Garter advanced to so high honor and estimation
as to account themselves happy to wear it.”</p></div>

<p>This story is generally regarded by historians as untrue.
Ashmole intimates that it was first published by Polydore
Virgil about the middle of the sixteenth century.
If that be so, the story in <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em> is the
earliest known version of this famous incident. The
word “Puni” instead of “Honi” is striking, but not
surprising. In the pronunciation of these words, as well
as in their written or printed forms, the hearer or the
reader might easily mistake the one for the other, and
the substitution would have been favored by the fact
that “Honi” was not in common use.</p>

<p>But let us follow the account concerning the Order as
we find it in <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em>. In the castle at Windsor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>was prepared a beautiful chapel which was to serve as
a home for the new fraternity. The king was the first
to take the oath to obey its statutes and ordinances.
Then he selected twenty-five other knights to constitute
its membership, and the first one chosen was Tirant,
because he was the best of all. Then the following
were named: “lo Princep de Gales, lo Duch de Beta
fort [Bedford], lo Duch de lencastre [Lancaster], lo
Duch datçetera [Exeter], lo Marques de Sofolch [Suffolk],
lo Marques de Sanct Jordi, lo Marques de Belpuig,
Johan de Varoych, Gran Conestable, lo Comte de Nortabar
[Northumberland], lo Comte de Salasberi, lo Comte
destafort [Stafford], lo Comte de Vilamur, lo Comte
de les Marches Negres, lo Comte d’la Joyosa Guarda,
lo Senyor de Scala Rompuda, lo Senyor de Puig Vert,
lo Senyor de Terra Noua, Miçer Johan Stuart, Miçer
de Riuçech.” All these were from the kingdom. The
foreigners were: “lo Duch de Berri, lo Duch Danjou,
lo Comte de Flandes.” Then the author says: “Foren
tots en nombre .xxvi. cauallers.” But, including the
king and Tirant, he has named only twenty-four.</p>

<p>According to history, Edward the Third founded the
Order of the Garter between the years 1344 and 1351.
The roll of founders consists of twenty-six names. Besides
those of the king and the Prince of Wales, there
are only four names given by Martorell that can be found
on the roll. The Duke of Exeter was elected into the
Order in 1400 and his is the ninety-ninth name on the
list of members. The Duke of Suffolk was elected in
1420 and his number is one hundred and forty on the
list. From a historical standpoint, Martorell made a
blunder when he gave the name of Sir John Stuart as
a member, for the latter was an enemy of England.
Several of the names seem to be pure inventions. It is
evident that Martorell made up a list of his own. At
first we are surprised that he did not include the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
of William of Warwick, but since the latter had so resolutely
insisted upon living as a hermit, he could not
consistently have been made a member. We have noticed
that instead of naming twenty-six, he named but twenty-four.
Why did he not name the Duke of Gloucester,
whom he mentions in his work? It is indeed surprising
that he did not name one of the Portuguese kings, for
John I, Edward, and Alphonse V were all members of
the Order. The latter was the brother of Prince Ferdinand,
to whom the book was dedicated. If Martorell
had known that these kings were honored with membership
in the noble Order, he would hardly have failed to
mention one of them. But he named none of these, and
consequently the conclusion may be drawn that he did
not live at the court of Portugal and that he knew little
more about Prince Ferdinand than his name. And, moreover,
these omissions indicate rather strongly that the
work was not first written in the Portuguese language.</p>

<p>We are furthermore told in <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em> that the
king gave to every member of the Order a collar of gold
covered with round S’s. Martorell undertakes in the
following story to explain how the king happened to
adopt these letters as a device: At a royal hunt, a deer,
white as the snow because of its age, was slain, and a
collar bearing S’s was found around its neck. On the
collar were found words stating that when Julius Caesar
left the island the collar was put on the deer, with the
request that the king into whose hands the deer might
fall should adopt the letter S as a device. The author
explains the significance of this letter in these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>“E lo collar era tots de esses redones. E perço com
en tot lo A.B.C. no trobareu letra una per una de major
auctoritat e perfectio que pugua significar mes altes coses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>que aquesta lettra S.... La primera, sanctedat; sauiesa;
sapiencia; senyoria; e moltes altres coses que per S
principien.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_71_71" id="Footnote_71_71"></a><a href="#FNanchor_71_71">[71]</a> And the collar was all covered with round S’s. Because in
the whole alphabet you cannot find one letter of greater authority
and perfection and which can signify more noble things than this
letter S. The first thing it stands for is sanctity; then sapience;
science; seigniory; and many other things that begin with S.
<em>Tirant lo Blanch</em>, chaps. xcvi and xcvii.</p></div>

<p>Martorell may have invented this story, but we are
inclined to believe that he had heard or read an explanation
of the kind. Perhaps the story was current at
the time. Ashmole, too, had his curiosity aroused by
the letters on the collars, and remembers that he had
read or heard that there was once an organization called
the “Society of Saint Simplicius” and that the members
of that society used to wear collars with SS on them,
and these letters stood for Saint Simplicius. This saint
suffered martyrdom under Diocletian about 287 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span></p>

<p>All that Martorell has to say about the rules, ceremonies,
initiation, ladies of honor and their vows, reveals
that he knew a great deal about the Order. Where did
he obtain his information? Was it through reading or
through hearsay? In some respects his account resembles
that of an eye-witness, yet in giving the names of members
of the Order, Martorell was obliged to invent some,
for the reason that he did not have enough English
names at his command. Some of the names are purely
Catalan, and this fact indicates that the account was not
written in England, nor in Portugal, but very probably
in Valencia; another argument in favor of the contention
that <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em> was written originally in Catalan,
and not in Portuguese.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III
<br />
<small>TIRANT SUCCORS THE KNIGHTS OF RHODES</small></h3>


<p>In the analysis we have told that the Genoese made
a treacherous attempt to capture Rhodes on account
of its commercial importance as a seaport. Having
failed in their effort, they induced the sultan to undertake
the conquest of the island, and within a short
time the port of Rhodes was blockaded, the city besieged,
and the island overrun by a multitude of Moors.
The city, however, offered heroic resistance. The Grand
Master appealed to the Christian powers for help. Tirant’s
aid finally led to the raising of the siege. Now
upon what historical facts is this part of the work based?</p>

<p>Let us first consider the attempt of the Genoese to
capture the city of Rhodes. The plan agreed upon was
to have a considerable number of their ships in the port,
and other vessels carrying many men were to be near by,
but far enough away so as not to be seen by the people
of Rhodes. Two Genoese members of the Order rendered
the instruments of defense of the castle useless. The
plan was to be carried out on Good Friday. While the
ceremonies of the day were being celebrated, the Genoese
were to enter the church two by two. All were to carry
arms, but they were to be concealed under long black
cloaks. After a large number of them had entered, they,
with the assistance of the two traitors, were to seize the
towers and finally the whole city. But their plan was
fortunately discovered and frustrated.</p>

<p>Knowing the author’s inclination for taking ideas from
certain sources and applying them under circumstances
that are altogether different from those under which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
they originally occurred, we shall quote the following
passage from Vertot’s history of this military order,
which describes an event that may have furnished some
details to the story of the unsuccessful venture of the
Genoese. The passage refers to a banquet given by
Jacques de Lusignan, when the regency of the government
of Cyprus was committed to him.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Il se trouva à ce repas royal un grand nombre
de Seigneurs Vénitiens et Génois. Ces étrangers
se disputèrent la préséance; elle fut décidée ce
jour-là en faveur des Vénitiens. Les Génois
pour s’en venger, résolurent de l’emporter la
force à la main et ils convinrent entr’eux de se
trouver le lendemain au palais avec des armes
cachées sous leurs manteaux. Le Régent ayant
été averti de leur complot, fit jeter par les fenêtres
du Palais huit nobles Génois qui se promenoient....<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p></div>

de Jérusalem</em>, Paris, 1726; Livre VI, p. 155.</p></div>

<p>Martorell began his work in 1460, seven years after
the fall of Constantinople. We are told that Mahomet
the Second had said: “Constantinople first and then
Rhodes.” The sultan notified the Grand Master of
the Knights of Saint John that he would not respect the
treaty entered into by Amurates and the Order. The
defiant answer to this challenge, in the words of a Spanish
historian of the Order, was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Respondió dignamente la Orden que reconocida
como Estado por todas las naciones cristianas y
por los soldanes turcos, sólo dependía de la Santa
Sede; que el Gran Maestre jamás la haría tributaria
ni súbdita de nadie, y que la religión de
Rodas estaba no por mujeres, sino por hombres
que temían á Dios y sabían llevar la espada.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p></div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>This peril that was ever threatening Rhodes may have
suggested to Martorell that it would offer a favorable
field for the exploits of Tirant. And we are inclined
to believe that the siege of Rhodes conducted by the
Sultan of Egypt in 1444, is the real historical event
upon which Tirant’s relief expedition is based. Some
time prior to that date the Grand Master de Lastic,
being aware of the fact that the sultan was planning to
make a supreme effort to capture Rhodes, sent ambassadors
to most of the rulers in Europe to implore help,
but, like the King of France in <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em>, they
did not respond. The attack on Rhodes was made in
the month of August, 1444. Let us quote Vertot’s
version of the event.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Une flotte considérable du Sultan parut de
nouveau à la hauteur de l’Isle de Rhodes, et y
débarqua dix-huit mille hommes d’infanterie, sans
compter un gros corps de cavalerie et de Mamelus,
qui faisoient la principale force des Egyptiens.
Ces Barbares sans s’arrêter à aucune des Places de
l’Isle, marchèrent droit à la Capitale, et l’assiegèrent,
pendant que leur flotte tenoit la mer pour
le port et empêcha qu’on n’y jettât du secours.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p></div>

<p>There are no details of this siege on record. Vertot
deplores this fact, but he consoles himself by saying:
“Ces Chevaliers sçavoient mieux se servir de leur épée
que d’une plume.” However, the records give the
general information that the siege lasted forty days;
that the fortifications were bombarded by many pieces
of heavy artillery; that many assaults were made which
were always repulsed; and that, after having lost the
greater part of his men, the Saracen commander gave
orders to raise the siege.</p>

<p>In the discussion of the relation between Muntaner’s
<em>Chronica</em> and <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em>, we have intimated that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>Tirant’s landing at the castle of Rhodes was copied in
a general way from Roger de Flor’s successful attempt
to bring relief to the besieged city of Messina. In the
analysis we have remarked that Tirant waited at the
castle of Saint Peter for favorable weather conditions to
run the blockade. This castle was built on the shores
of Asia Minor, in or about the year 1402, under the
direction of the Grand Master de Naillac; consequently
the date of the siege of Rhodes in <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em> cannot
be assigned to a period before that year.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV
<br />
<small>TIRANT JOINS THE EXPEDITION OF THE KING OF FRANCE
AGAINST THE INFIDELS</small></h3>


<p>Some of the facts concerning this expedition are:
the King of France set sail from Aiguesmortes; his son,
Philip, who was in charge of the fleet of the King of
Sicily, took part in this enterprise; at Tripoli in Syria,
Tirant, fully armed, leaped from his vessel into the water
and was the first to set his foot on the hostile shore;
the stock of provisions was replenished on the island of
Cyprus; and towards the close of this military enterprise,
Tunis was taken.</p>

<p>The following historical facts indicate that the story of
the expedition was based on the Crusades of Louis IX.
Saint Louis set out on his Crusades from Aiguesmortes;
he had a son named Philip who accompanied
him on the second Crusade; in Cyprus, an abundance
of provisions had been stored in advance for the use of
the first Crusade; when the king arrived at Damietta,
he leaped into the water and was among the first to
step on Saracen soil; and Tunis was captured at the time
of the second Crusade and was obliged to pay tribute
to the King of Sicily, although this last event happened
after the death of the French king.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most striking of these coincidences is the
one in which these heroic figures leap into the water.
Joinville, in his <em>Histoire de Saint Loys</em>, describes this
incident in the following words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Quant le bon roy Saint Loys sceut, que l’enseigne
saint Denis fut arrivée à terre, il sortit de

<h3>CHAPTER V
<br />
<small>TIRANT CONQUERS AND CHRISTIANIZES ALL BARBARY</small></h3>


<p>Tirant’s next field of operation is at Constantinople,
which has already been discussed. It must be remembered
that he began his work of freeing the Greek empire
from the power of the Turks auspiciously. But on returning
to his army by sea, his vessel was driven by a
tempest to the African shores, where he was shipwrecked.
After having conquered Barbary and brought about the
conversion of many thousands to the Christian faith,
he returned to Constantinople to complete the restoration
of the empire. Consequently, there remains for
us the task of ascertaining what historical basis underlies
the story of the conquest of Barbary.</p>

<p>When the author began his work, the Portuguese were
busy fighting the Moors in Africa. Prince Ferdinand
of Portugal, who was Martorell’s patron, according to
the dedicatory letter, was at that very time taking part
in the African campaigns. But, to our surprise, the conquest
of Barbary does not reveal any significant traces
of the Portuguese wars against the Moors. The valiant
Moorish Governor, Sale ben Sale (Cale ben Cale in <em>Tirant
lo Blanch</em>), plays an important rôle in resisting the Portuguese,
but the reference that is made to him in Martorell’s
work is not in connection with the conquest of Barbary.
He is mentioned in the William of Warwick episode
as the successor of the Moorish king who was slain by
the hermit-king. Tirant’s conquest of Barbary and the
war of the Portuguese against the Moors had one object
in common, viz., the Christianization of northwestern
Africa. With Tirant, it became the chief purpose; with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the Portuguese, it seems to have been secondary, for
their supreme aim was to rid themselves of a constantly
menacing enemy. It is possible that the campaigns
of the Portuguese against the African Moors
attracted the attention of Martorell, and, seeing that
a similar undertaking would provide an excellent field
in which his hero might win additional laurels, he determined
to write and plan an imaginary account of
a conquest of that territory. But if this feature owes
its origin to Portuguese history, would it not be natural
to expect in that account traces and reminders of the
military activities of the kingdom of Portugal? Did
this field not offer a wonderful opportunity to glorify
the deeds of Prince Ferdinand or, at least, of his people?
But all efforts to connect Tirant’s conquest with the
campaigns of the Portuguese are in vain. Here, then,
is another strong indication that what the author says in
the dedicatory letter concerning the translation of an
English original into Portuguese is pure invention, for
we are certain that no English <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em> existed
and that Martorell wrote an original work in which he
created a hero according to his own good will and pleasure.
The various qualities of this hero manifested themselves
in certain spheres of operation which, as has already
been pointed out in all other cases, were based on real
historical conditions and events. We are told that
<em>Tirant lo Blanch</em> was written at the request of a Portuguese
prince, and yet Portuguese heroism and glory
find no place in the work, although there are occasions
exceedingly favorable for praises of Prince Ferdinand
and his people. It seems almost an act of disloyalty to
his patron for Martorell to have passed over in silence
the opportunities of lauding Portuguese valor and honor.
All this indicates that the Catalan author did not reside
at the court of Portugal; that he did not write the book
in the Portuguese language; and that probably he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
not requested by a prince of that nation to write <em>Tirant
lo Blanch</em>, for its contents in no way support the statements
made in the dedicatory letter; on the contrary,
they seem to refute them.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_78_78" id="Footnote_78_78"></a><a href="#FNanchor_78_78">[78]</a> See page 77.</p></div>

<p>Is the conquest of Barbary perhaps based on some other
historical venture or event? We feel justified in answering
the question affirmatively, for Muntaner’s <em>Chronica</em>
seems to have furnished the background for Tirant’s
exploits in Barbary. In Martorell’s narration of this
conquest the following historical personages and geographical
names are of importance: the King of Tremicen,
the King of Tunis, Bugia, and Constantine. All these
are found in Muntaner’s <em>Chronica</em>, in certain parts of
which are described the hostile relations between the
Moors of Africa and the crown of Aragon. In both
accounts all Barbary [“tota la Barbaria”] is specifically
mentioned. This fact is significant.</p>

<p>In Chapter XIX of the <em>Chronica</em> Muntaner relates
that the tribute due to the King of Aragon from the
King of Tremicen and the King of Tunis had not been
paid for a long time, and for this reason four well-armed
galleys were sent from Valencia to Tunis and Bugia.
These wrought great devastation along the African shores
and besieged the important ports. While in these waters
they came upon a fleet of ten galleys, all strongly armed
and manned, belonging to the King of Morocco. The
Aragonese ships bravely attacked those of the Moors and
succeeded in capturing the whole fleet, which they took
back with them to Valencia.</p>

<p>When Peter the Second became King of Aragon and
Catalonia, he determined to force the kings of Tremicen
and Tunis to pay the tribute. An expedition was sent
to Barbary, and as a result Miraboaps, the King of Tunis,
was driven from the throne and his brother Mirabusach
was put in his place. The latter pledged himself to pay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>the tribute, and signed a treaty with the Aragonese in
which he granted them important rights and privileges
in his kingdom. Some time later Miraboaps fomented
a rebellion in Bugia and Constantine against his brother
and succeeded in making himself king of these two
cities. When he died he divided between his two sons,
Mirabosecri and Bugron, the territory over which he
ruled. The former became King of Bugia and the latter
ruler over Constantine. But Mirabosecri was not satisfied;
he wished to hold sway over Constantine also,
and accordingly he made preparations to take that city
from his brother.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Bugron saw that he could offer but feeble resistance
against the ambition of his brother. So he sent messengers
to King Peter to inform him that he wished to
become a Christian and a subject of the crown of Aragon.
This message brought great joy to the heart of the king,
who immediately began to build many ships to transport
a large army to Africa. So extensive were his preparations
that the lords and princes, Christians as well as Saracens,
who held territory along the seas, became alarmed,
for he told no one what he intended to do. The English
king, the French king, and the Pope made inquiries,
but he would not reveal his plans. Not until the expedition
was far out upon the sea did the commanders
of the ships receive instructions as to their destination.
When Bugron was informed that the army of the King of
Aragon was on its way, he became elated and disclosed
to some of his intimate friends what he purposed to do,
whereupon they arose in great wrath and cut off his head.
King Peter’s army landed at Alcoyll, not far distant from
Bugia. The king was shocked when he heard of Bugron’s
tragic death, but he concluded, nevertheless, to stay
there and wage war upon the Saracens. Fortifications
were immediately constructed. Formidable forces of
Moors came to attack the Christians, but were always
repulsed. Troops from the vast Aragonese army made
incursions into the surrounding country, and soon none
of the enemy could be found for miles around. King
Peter was highly pleased with this excellent beginning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
and it did not seem to him that the conquest of all Barbary
would be a difficult task if the Pope would only
furnish sufficient money to pursue the undertaking to
a successful issue. Accordingly he sent an ambassador
to Rome to secure this necessary financial assistance.
Let us quote a few lines of the ambassador’s petition
to the Pope:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Pare sanct, mon senyor lo rey En Pere Darago
vos fa saber quell es en Barbaria en un lloch qui
ha nom Alcoyll, e troba que per aquell lloch pot
auer tota la Barbaria. Si vos, pare sanct, li
volets fer ajuda de diners e de perdonança,
sera aço complit de la major part auans que
llonch temps sia. E la Barbaria es aytal, que qui
haura les marines si haura tota la Barbaria. E
son gents qui tantost com vejen lo gran destret
que hauran se faran chrestians la major part.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_79_79" id="Footnote_79_79"></a><a href="#FNanchor_79_79">[79]</a> Holy Father, my lord king Peter of Aragon informs you that
he is in Barbary in a certain place called Alcoyll and finds that with
that place as base of operations, he can conquer all Barbary. If
you, Holy Father, will aid him with money and indulgences, this
will be accomplished within a short time. The situation of Barbary
is such that he who has possession of the littoral will also hold all
Barbary. And they are people who as soon as they see the great
distress that they will have to endure will for the greater part become
Christians. Muntaner, <em>op. cit.</em>; chap. lii.</p></div>

<p>In the meantime ambassadors came from the island of
Sicily to implore King Peter to come thither and free them
from the oppressive rule of Charles of Anjou. But the
king’s heart was so firmly set upon this conquest that he
gave no heed to their entreaties. But when another
embassy came, and when he was informed that his petition
to the Pope had met with failure, he embarked with
all his forces and sailed for Sicily. And thus the high
purpose of lo Senyor rey En Pere to conquer and christianize
all Barbary came to naught.</p></div>

<p>This undertaking of the King of Aragon furnished the
historical background for Tirant’s wonderful campaign
against the Moors in Barbary. Martorell did not make
use of the details of the Aragonese expedition, but he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>took up the subject and some of the geographical names
and historical personages and developed a story of conquest
according to his fancy. The enterprise of the Aragonese
king was a failure, but Tirant’s was naturally a
glorious achievement.</p>

<p>It is quite probable that the shipwreck of Heraud as
described in the sequel to the romance of <em>Guy of Warwick</em>
led to the conception and composition of the conquest.
Tirant, like Heraud, was shipwrecked on the African
shores, was made prisoner, and became the leader of
Moorish forces. And now that Martorell had taken his
hero to Africa, what undertaking was he to engage in
there? King Peter’s expedition came to the mind of
the author, and he decided to have Tirant accomplish
what the king had tried to do. It is possible, however,
that Martorell conceived his hero as conqueror of Barbary
even before he thought of the way in which he was
to arrive there. But the first theory seems more plausible,
for the reason that in Tirant’s first activities in
Africa no conquest of Barbary and no religious motives
are apparent.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI
<br />
<small>CONCLUSION: GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF TIRANT LO BLANCH</small></h3>


<p>The Catalan romance of chivalry, <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em>,
may be described as a composite historical novel with a
hero of a composite historical character. From the beginning
of the work to the end of the William of Warwick
episode the scenes are laid in England, and were it not
for the fact that Martorell describes a Moorish invasion
as taking place in that kingdom, we should be obliged
to say that the atmosphere is absolutely English. However,
after Tirant’s return to the continent, a purely
Catalan or Aragonese spirit pervades the romance to the
very end. The names of other countries may be given
as the scenes of Tirant’s activities, but the Catalan
heart and mind are always in evidence. The author’s
direct experience and his intimate acquaintance with the
history of his country find expression at every favorable
opportunity. Whatever is described or narrated bears
a pronounced Catalan stamp. Tirant’s relief expedition
to Rhodes is based on the siege of that place in 1444,
but the manner in which he succeeded in reaching the
castle was copied from Roger de Flor’s successful attempt
to relieve Messina. The expedition of the King of France
against the infidels is based on the crusades of Louis IX;
yet the way that it ravaged the shores of Turkey was
very similar to the manner in which the vessels of King
Jaime, King Peter’s predecessor, devastated the shores of
Africa. Tirant’s activities in the service of the Emperor
of Constantinople are based on the Catalan-Aragonese
expedition to the East under the leadership of Roger
de Flor, but it cannot be forgotten that the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
romance, <em>Guy of Warwick</em>, has left strong and indisputable
traces in this part of the work. The conquest of Barbary
is based on the experiences of the kings of Aragon
with the Saracens of northwestern Africa, but, in making
use of these historical elements, Martorell absolutely
disregards their chronological order. According to these
historical data, Tirant’s military career begins in the
middle of the fifteenth century and ends incongruously
in the early years of the fourteenth. The hero is made
up of elements taken from Guy of Warwick, Richard
of Beauchamp, Roger de Flor, Saint Louis, Peter the
Second of Aragon and others. It is clear that Martorell
had no intention of singing the praises of Roger de Flor
or of any other historical personage. In fact it seems
that he attempts to disguise and conceal the historical
elements. If he had adhered to these elements too
closely, he would by that very act have deprived himself
of the liberty of proceeding with his composition as he
pleased.</p>

<p>Martorell had probably no other purpose in view than
that of writing a romance of chivalry in which the hero
was to conform in the main to his notion of what constituted
a great military leader. He was of a practical
bent and he desired to present to us a lifelike hero, one
whose exploits should be within the bounds of possibility.
All material that was given place in his work seems to be
based on what he himself directly observed or what he
had read or heard related. No wild flights of the imagination
are attempted. Occasionally passages are met with
relating incredible occurrences, but these are not of his
own invention. Within this work may be found religious
and philosophical discourses; speeches and disputations
among members of the imperial councils;
formal debates among members of the imperial family;
documents and papers drawn up by notaries; formal
challenges and replies to these; dramatic lamentations;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
long and fervent prayers; and allusions to classical
Latin authors, to biblical characters and to figures prominent
in mediaeval literature. Many of these features
bear evidence that they are not original with Martorell,
but were copied, some closely, others loosely, from models
that he found here and there. But at times he is delightfully
original. On these occasions his narrations are
natural and the dialogues exceedingly sprightly, making
a striking contrast with his other heavy and stilted literary
efforts. It is to be regretted that he did not cast aside
the models that he copied or imitated, and free himself
from the influence of other authors. His book would in
that case have been reduced to approximately one-fourth
of its present size, but quite probably it would now be
considered a masterpiece of narration and dialogue.</p>

<p>Martorell, to judge him by the work that he has produced—unfortunately
we know nothing at all concerning
him from any other source—gives us the impression
that he was a monk or an ecclesiastic. The intensely
religious spirit that pervades the book, the sermons and
prayers, and the efforts to conquer or crush the enemies
of the Holy Catholic Church point strongly in that
direction. His high regard for the orders of knighthood
and his great admiration for distinguished heroes give
some grounds for believing that he was a member of a
military order. However, the various documents drawn
up in legal form leave the impression that he was a
notary. But he has included in his work several features
that are not in harmony with a serious and lofty
purpose. From these a fair idea of his character and disposition
may be obtained. He is jolly, jovial, frivolous,
talkative, <em>malicieux</em>, and bold even to impertinence. He
is queer and eccentric. He has peculiar ideas as to
the fitness of things. He shows extremely bad taste
from the standpoint of the present time. Sometimes
he permits his hero to conduct himself in an undignified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
manner, or makes him the victim of mishaps that tend
to decrease our admiration for him. And then as a
climax to these occasional disparaging portrayals, he
endows his hero with a low, immoral nature.</p>

<p>Tirant lo Blanch is pictured to us as a noble, generous,
religious, intrepid, valiant, and invincible military leader.
He is admirable in all respects but one—he is morally
a weakling. This inconsistency, together with other incongruities,
has led a scholarly critic<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> to declare that
<em>Tirant lo Blanch</em> is a parody on the romances of chivalry
and that “the animus of the whole narrative is satire.”
But the romance taken as a whole does not warrant
such a conclusion, for the general tone of it is earnest
and sincere. Several features of the work seem to be
presented in a satirical spirit, but still it is very doubtful
that the author intended to hold up certain foibles, follies
or vices to reprobation and ridicule. Is it not rather
probable that these features are due to the realistic
tendencies of the author, or to his whims and humors?
Were some of these features perhaps intended as a protest
against the immorality of knights in general? Were they
to teach a moral lesson? If these questions are answered
affirmatively, difficulties will confront us, for Hypolite, the
paramour of the empress, is not punished for his sinful
liaison; on the contrary he is rewarded, for after the
death of the emperor and the princess he becomes the
imperial ruler and his reign is a long and glorious one.
Nor was he to be punished in the next world, for we
are told “... e podeu creure que per lo bon regiment,
e per la bona e virtuosa vida fon [Lemperador e la
Emperadriu] collocats en la gloria de paradis.”<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> It is
impossible to believe that it was Martorell’s purpose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>to deride and ridicule the deeds of prowess and the noble
enterprises of the champion knight of the English court,
the deliverer of the Knights of Rhodes, the intrepid
knight of the French king’s expedition against the infidels,
the missionary-conqueror of Barbary, and the liberator of
the Grecian Empire. Surely the spirit of the narration of
these important activities of Tirant is not satire.</p>

the glories of paradise.</p></div>

<p>This Catalan romance of chivalry may have been
conceived in accordance with the taste of Martorell’s
times, but conditions have changed. The standards by
which we measure the actions of men now are not the
same as they were then. If an author wishes us to become
enthusiastic in our admiration for his hero, the latter must
conform to our standards. We insist that the protagonist
be, above all, heroic from a moral standpoint. If
he lacks that attribute we cannot give him a full measure
of appreciation. An immoral hero is a paradox, an
impossibility with us of the present day; consequently
we shall never be able to regard Tirant lo Blanch as a
great hero. But from the foregoing study it may perhaps
appear that the “cura’s” estimate, composed both of
enthusiasm and reprobation (as set forth in the passage
quoted in the opening paragraph), is not unworthy of the
good sense and critical acumen of the great Cervantes.</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
